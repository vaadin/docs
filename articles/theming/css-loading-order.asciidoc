= CSS Loading Order

Application Theme is a recommended way to organize themes in a Vaadin application, however, Vaadin still supports the old ways to set the styles, like a CSS import and StyleSheet annotations.
Styles applied with a different approaches have different loading order, i.e. the priority they are computed in the browser and possibly override each other.

In order to keep the application theming and styles consistent and well-formed, it's important to take into account the loading order of the following CSS sources:

. `Lumo` theme
. Parent theme (_if used_)
. Current theme
. Application-specific bundled CSS added via `@CssImport` (_if used_)
. Application-specific unbundled CSS added via `@Stylesheet` (_if used_)
. Styles added on Java side via `Page::addStylesheet` (_if used_)

NOTE: `Lumo` theme won't be loaded and applied if another theme class is provided, like this `@Theme(themeClass = MyCustomTheme.class)`, or if
`@NoTheme` found.

Styles with a bigger loading order have a bigger precedence.
For example, the following style, if placed in `global.css` within the Application Theme folder `frontend/themes/my-theme`, will override the default `Lumo` font size `1rem` with `0.875rem`:

html {
    --lumo-font-size-m: 0.875rem;
}
