= Creating Pull Requests for Vaadin Projects

All bugs and enhancements are tracked in corresponding GitHub issues.
If you are unsure where to start, you can pick one of the issues marked with "Help Wanted" or "Good First Issue" labels.
For a general usage ask questions and join discussions on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=vaadin[StackOverflow] or https://discord.gg/vaadin[Vaadin Discord chat].

== Before You Send a Pull Request

To ensure maintainability, product quality, and to avoid API inconsistencies, it's important that all enhancements and new features are first discussed in a GitHub issue.
Project teams can also help you with acceptance criteria (a set of user stories), that states what's the expected use-case.

== Basic Requirements

All contributions should target the `master` branch of a repository/project.
The project teams pick changes to correct version branches from the there.

A quality patch follows good coding practices – it's easy to read and understand.
For more complicated fixes or features, break down the change into several smaller, easy to understand patches.

== Describe Your Changes

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Will = NO -->]

=== Subject line

Start with a good subject message in imperative form with 50 chars or less.
A well formed Git PR subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:
"If applied, this PR will <__your subject line here__>"

Depending of type of changes you are doing, the subject line should start with `feat`, `fix`, `chore` or `refactor`.
In case there are breaking changes, put `!` after the prefix, like `refactor!:`.
If you aren't sure what to write there, let the reviewer do it when merging the PR.

feat: Create a Valo icon font for icons in Valo

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Will = YES -->]

=== Describe the Problem

Whether your patch is a one-line bug fix or 5000 lines of a new feature, there must be an underlying problem that motivated you to do this work.
Convince the reviewer that there is a problem worth fixing and that it makes sense for them to read past the first paragraph.
This is often already described in bug/enhancement issue, but also summarize it in your commit message.

----
Valo uses only a handful of icons from Font Awesome.

=== Describe the User Impact and Solution

Straight up crashes and lockups are pretty convincing, but not all bugs are that blatant.
Even if the problem was spotted during code review, describe the impact you think it can have on users.

Once the problem is established, describe what you are actually doing about it in technical detail.
It's important to describe the change in plain English for the reviewer to verify that the code is behaving as you intend it to.
Describe your changes in imperative mood, for example "make X do Y".
If the patch fixes a logged bug entry, refer to that bug entry by number or URL.
However, try to make your explanation understandable without external resources.

If your description starts to get long, that's a sign that you probably need to split up your patch. See “<<separate-your-changes,Separate Your Changes>>”.

----
This change introduces a separate icon font for valo (9KB instead of 80KB) and decouples Valo from Font Awesome to enable updating Font Awesome without taking Valo into account.

This change also makes it easy to not load Font Awesome when using Valo by setting $v-font-awesome:false

For backwards compatibility, Font Awesome is loaded by default

=== Reference the Issue

Reference an issue number using https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue[the magic words] to close the issue.

If the issue isn't closed by this PR, you can still refer to it with the syntax `Part of #1234`.
In case the issue is in another repository, you can link to it with the syntax `Part of vaadin/spring#1234` where the first part is for the organization, the second for the repository followed by the issue (or PR) number there.

This change also makes it easy to not load Font Awesome when using Valo by setting $v-font-awesome:false

== Separate Your Changes

Separate all enhancements, fixes, and new features into different pull requests.

For example, if your changes include both bug fixes and performance enhancements, separate those changes into two or more patches.
If your changes include an API update, and a new component which uses that new API, separate those into two patches.

If you make a single change to several files, group those changes into a single patch when possible.
Thus a single logical change is contained within a single patch.

If one patch depends on another patch in order for a change to be complete, that's OK.
Add note "this patch depends on patch X" to your patch description.

When dividing your change into a series of patches, take special care to ensure that the project builds and runs after each patch in the series.
Compilation failures are especially annoying to deal with.

== Style-Check Your Changes

Check your patch for basic style violations.
There should be none if your <<./editor-settings#,editor settings>> are set up correctly.

If you are touching old files and want to update them to current style conventions, do so in a separate commit/PR.
It's best to have this commit as the first in the series.

== Include a Test

Where applicable, patches should be accompanied with <<tests#,automated tests>>.
It allows to detect regressions during the build thus simplifying future maintenance.
Unit tests are the easiest to implement, but certain aspects (changes to the UI or session management code) might require an integration test.

After submitting a pull request, CI system triggers the verification build automatically, including integration tests, and reports results to the PR.

Test cases should succeed with the patch and fail without the patch.
This is a clear indication that the suggested fix/enhancement does what expected.

If the patch is aimed at the performance improvement, supplement it with a performance test code and a benchmark results showing performance impact.

== Respond to Review Comments

Code review is an essential part of PR acceptance process and is often a logical continuation of a discussion started in a GitHub issue.
Don't be offended if reviewer asks you to change the implementation or use a different approach.
Such changes are often required to align API with a new features being actively developed and to ensure backward-compatibility.

It's best to keep the conversation going in review comments and resolve all reviewer comments.
If the PR isn't approved by the reviewer and there is no response from the author in a reasonable time, PR is likely to be rejected.

Another aspect to consider is that, as time passes, more and more new features and fixes are merged into the `master` branch.
As a result, the more PR is waiting to be merged, the higher is the probability of merge conflicts.
Such conflicts must be resolved before the merge.
