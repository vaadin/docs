= Unit Testing in Flow
:experimental:
:commandkey: &#8984;

Every change in the code base requires a JUnit test for the code change.
In cases where a JUnit test is not plausible then an <<flow-integration-testing#,Integration Test>> should be added instead.

== Mocking
JUnit mocks use `Mockito` and other mocking libraries should not be used as they may break when there are version updates.
No new mocking libraries should be added to the project.

To help with tests there are many `Mock*` classes for use that make the setup for testing simpler.

== Conventions

JUnit tests should not leak settings and changes outside the test execution.
This means that any changes to current instances and system properties should be reset after the test execution.

Test method naming must follow the convention: `{given}_{when}_{then}`, for example:

.Example standard names for unit test methods:
[source]
----
void setValue_sameValue_firesNoEvent()
void setValue_differentValue_firesOneEvent()
----
It is always a good practice to refer to existing tests as an example to how to write new tests.

== How to Run the Tests

Running the following command results in running all the tests in the specified module:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn verify -pl <module-name>
----

You can execute tests for single class with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn -Dtest=<test-class-name> test -pl <module-folder-name>
----

Also, for running a single test inside a class:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn -Dtest=<test-class-name>#<test-method-name> test -pl <module-folder-name>
----

For running all the unit tests in the project:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn test -am -pl flow
----

For running tests through your IDE, please refer to the documentation of your desired IDE.

.Chrome Web Driver is required
[NOTE]
Running the unit tests in `flow-client` module needs a Chrome Web Driver to be available on your environment, and its version should be configured in [filename]#flow-client/intern.json#.
For more information about setting up the Web Driver, please refer to <<{articles}/tools/testbench/installing-webdrivers#,Installing Web Driver>>.
