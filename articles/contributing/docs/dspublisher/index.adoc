= Design System Publisher

Design System Publisher (DSP) is a tool used to compile the Vaadin website's documentation pages at vaadin.com/docs.

.No Longer Maintained for 3rd Party Use
[NOTE]
Design System Publisher is no longer maintained as a product for third-party use.
Existing installations should continue to work, but the latest Vaadin documentation is unlikely to work correctly with them.

For content, DSP uses https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc], a lightweight markup language similar to Markdown. The system supports embedding live component samples, written in Java or TypeScript, directly into the pages. The system can automatically provide code snippets for the samples for copy-pasting into code.
