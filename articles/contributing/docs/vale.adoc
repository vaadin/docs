= Vale

https://vale.sh[Vale] is a tool that checks the content you write, as well as reports problems based on a set of rules and guidelines. You should follow the <<styleguide#,Vaadin documentation guidelines>> when contributing to the Vaadin or Hilla documentation.


== Pull Request Reviews

The Vale rules are checked automatically during a pull request review, after you commit and push changes to the GitHub repository.

If the Vale check fails -- that is if it produces errors, warnings, or suggestions -- you can see those in the [guilabel]*Files changed* tab.

.Files Changed Tab

An annotation shows below the line where Vale detected an issue.

You should always fix any errors that Vale reports before you mark a pull request as ready for review. Try to resolve as many warnings and suggestions as you can, although sometimes it's acceptable, or even preferable, to ignore warnings and suggestions. For instance, the use of passive voice or future tense may be appropriate sometimes. 

If you're unsure how to fix an issue, you can ask for help from the documentation maintainers, or wait for someone to perform the required language check -- one of the next steps in a pull request that's ready for review.


== Use Locally

Vale is easiest to use together with VS Code and the https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-vscode[Vale extension]. You can also run Vale directly from the command-line by giving one or more AsciiDoc files as parameters:

----
$ vale page-filename.adoc

 page-filename.adoc
 154:32  suggestion  'simply' is a weasel word.      Vaadin.Weasel

âœ– 0 errors, 0 warnings and 1 suggestions in 1 file.
----

See the https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/[Vale documentation] for instructions on installing Vale on macOS, Windows, or Linux.


== Configuration

Vale is configured with the `.vale.ini` file in the root of the `vaadin/docs` project. A separate `.vale-pr.ini` configuration is used for pull requests. See the https://vale.sh/docs/topics/config/[Vale Configuration] documentation page to learn more.


== Vocabulary

If you get false spelling errors from the `Vale.Spelling` rule (e.g., for the word "Vaadin"), you can add words to the `.github/styles/Vocab/accept.txt` file to suppress them. See the https://vale.sh/docs/topics/vocab/[Vale Vocabularies] documentation page to learn more.


== Style Rules

The writing style rules are located in the `.githug/styles/Vaadin` folder. Each rule is in a separate YAML file. See the https://vale.sh/docs/topics/styles/[Vale Styles] documentation page to learn how to create new rules.

Occasionally, you might need to suppress a rule for certain parts of text. You can do that with a specific comment syntax. For example, if you want to use future tense, you can suppress the `Vaadin.Will` rule like so:

[source,asciidoc]
----
// tag::start[]
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Will = NO -->]
// end::start[]

If you really want it, it will be possible.

// tag::stop[]
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Will = YES -->]
// end::stop[]
----

Rules that use `scope: raw` (e.g., `Vaadin.SourceCode`) can't be suppressed with these comments.
