= Eclipse Editor Settings

This page describes the noticeable changes made to the default code formatting settings in Eclipse.
This is also a chance to review some of these changes and tweak them if necessary.
None of these are essential for a pull request, but they all help.
They can also be added after the original pull request but before a merge.

== General

- Line length is 80 characters
- Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Use unix-style line endings (`\n`)

== Code Conventions

. Open menu:Window[Preferences] (Windows) or menu:Eclipse[Preferences] (Mac)
. On the menu:Java[Code Style > Formatter] page, import your local copy of link:https://github.com/vaadin/flow/blob/master/eclipse/VaadinJavaConventions.xml[VaadinJavaConventions.xml]
. On the menu:Java[Code Style > Organize Imports] page, import your local copy of link:https://github.com/vaadin/flow/blob/master/eclipse/flow.importorder[flow.importorder]
. On the menu:Editor[Save Actions] tab, make sure that in case [guilabel]#Format source code# is active, the [guilabel]#Format edited lines option# is selected.
Never use the [guilabel]#Format all lines# option, as that may introduce loads of unnecessary code changes, making code reviews a nightmare.
. Go to menu:General[Workspace]
.. Set [guilabel]#Text file encoding# to *UTF-8*
.. Set [guilabel]#New text file line delimiter# to *Unix*
. Go to menu:XML[XML Files > Editor] and ensure the settings are configured as follows:
- [guilabel]#Line width#: *72*
- [guilabel]#Format comments#: *true*
- [guilabel]#Join lines#: *true*
- [guilabel]#Insert whitespace before closing empty end-tags#: *true*
- [guilabel]#Indent using spaces#: *true*
- [guilabel]#Indentation size#: *4*
