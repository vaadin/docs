==== Fusion Breaking Changes

[discrete]
==== Endpoints Access is Denied by Default

Previously, endpoints (methods in classes with `@Endpoint` annotation) without security annotations (one of `@DenyAll`, `@PermitAll`, `@RolesAllowed`, `@AnonymousAllowed`) were accessible by all authenticated users.
To avoid inadvertent exposure of methods as endpoints, `@DenyAll` is now the default.
This means that you need to add explicit security annotations to the endpoints that you want to make accessible (either at the class level or the method level).

==== Default Spring Security Configuration

A default class for Spring Security configuration is available as `VaadinWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Extend this class instead of the default `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` to automatically get a configuration that allows Vaadin specific requests to pass through security while requiring authorization for all other requests:

.`SecurityConfiguration.java`
[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfiguration extends VaadinWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        super.configure(http);
        // app's own HttpSecurity configuration as needed ...
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {
        super.configure(web);
        // app's own WebSecurity configuration as needed...
    }
}
----

`VaadinWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` configures authentication for all routes by default.
Modify this behavior with your own followup configuration as needed.
It also bypasses framework internal and static resources (`/VAADIN/**`, `sw.js` ...).
Previously, these had to be explicitly matched and ignored in the app.

`VaadinWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` also configures Spring CSRF token for login and Fusion endpoint requests, so you no longer need to ignore Spring CSRF protection for them like before with `http.csrf().ignoringAntMatchers("/login", "/connect/**");`

The client-side `login()` method now needs the Spring CSRF token returned from a login success handler `VaadinSavedRequestAwareAuthenticationSuccessHandler`.
You can update your login view configuration with the `setLoginView()` helper, which sets up the login success handler automatically.

.`SecurityConfig.java`
