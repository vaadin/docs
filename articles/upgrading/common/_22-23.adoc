==== Hilla as a Standalone Platform
Fusion used to be part of the Vaadin platform, now it is separated from Vaadin and packaged as a standalone platform.
Hilla and Vaadin work seamlessly together, as long as the versions match. 
They share the same minor and patch versions, the difference is that Vaadin has 23 as the major version while Hilla has 1.

If an application needs the Hilla features, such as Endpoint, it can be updated to also include the hilla dependency in the `pom.xml` file.
Here is an example of how to do that:
[source, xml]
----
<vaadin.version>23.0.0</vaadin.version>
<!-- add the hilla version -->
<hilla.version>1.0.0</hilla.version>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-bom</artifactId>
    <version>${vaadin.version}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- add the hilla bom -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.hilla</groupId>
    <artifactId>hilla-bom</artifactId>
    <version>${hilla.version}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- add the hilla dependency -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.hilla</groupId>
    <artifactId>hilla</artifactId>
</dependency>

==== npm as the Default Frontend Package Manager
Starting from Vaadin 23, `npm` is used as the default frontend package manager, since the performance of `npm` has been improved and it is possible to lock dependency versions with npm https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides[overrides feature].
`pnpm` is still supported.
To continue using pnpm, set the <<{articles}/shared/guide/configuration/_npm-pnpm#, pnpm.enable flag>> to true.
