=== npm as the Default Frontend Package Manager
Starting from Vaadin 23, `npm` is used as the default frontend package manager, since the performance of `npm` has been improved and it's possible to lock dependency versions with the `npm` https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides[overrides feature].
`pnpm` is still supported.
To continue using `pnpm`, set the <<{articles}/configuration/npm-pnpm#, pnpm.enable flag>> to true.
