- Using [classname]`LitTemplate` is recommended over the deprecated [classname]`PolymerTemplate` to do layouts with HTML and UI logic in Java.

It's recommended to use TypeScript for the template and this has been updated to the examples in the <<{articles}/create-ui/templates#,documentation>>.

- Starting from Vaadin 18, the initial attribute values in the template are reflected to the server side state when `@Id` mapping components.
This applies to [classname]`PolymerTemplate`, too.
More information on the template support is available in this https://vaadin.com/blog/future-of-html-templates-in-vaadin[blog post].
