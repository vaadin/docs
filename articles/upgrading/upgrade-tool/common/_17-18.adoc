- Using `LitTemplate` is recommended over deprecated `PolymerTemplate` for doing layouts with HTML and UI logic in Java. It is recommended to use TypeScript for the template and this has been updated to the examples in the https://vaadin.com/docs/v18/flow/templates/tutorial-template-intro.html[documentation].

- Starting from Vaadin 18, the initial attribute values in the template are reflected to the server side state when `@Id` mapping components. This applies to `PolymerTemplate` too. More information on the template support is available in this https://vaadin.com/blog/future-of-html-templates-in-vaadin[blog post].
