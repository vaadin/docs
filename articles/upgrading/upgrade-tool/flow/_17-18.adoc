=== Flow Breaking Changes

- `AppShellRegistry` method `getTitle()` is removed 
It was broken and could not work. Instead, if needed, use `getUI().getUIInternals().getAppShellTitle()`. 

- Having the `@Theme` annotation on Flow views or router layouts will no longer be allowed.
The annotation should be on [interfacename]`AppShellConfigurator` instead. 
This is now consistent with the `@PWA` annotation.
It is also cleaner, since you can only have one `@Theme` per application. 


- `AbstractListDataView` now requires an extra constructor argument - a callback, which is invoked each time when the component's filter and/or sorting changes through the data view API.
