=== Fusion Breaking Changes

[discrete]
==== Fusion Package Renaming
In order to give Fusion a better identity, we renamed the following Fusion packages:

* `com.vaadin.flow.server.connect` to `com.vaadin.fusion`
* `com.vaadin.flow.server.frontend.fusion` to `com.vaadin.fusion.frontend`
* `com.vaadin.flow.server.startup.fusion` to `com.vaadin.fusion.startup`

==== TypeScript Code Generation Nullability Change
Previously, all the Java types are generated as required in TypeScript.
Now it changes so that for any type that is nullable in Java, it is optional in TypeScript, that is, the value could be `undefined`. See https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/8849[the GitHub issue].

To upgrade, you can either:
Update the client-side code to handle undefinable value.
[source,typescript]
----
// The address property is never undefined in Vaadin 20
person.address.street
// Use the question mark to deal with undefinable properties in Vaadin 21
person.address?.street


// The list returned from the endpoint is never undefined in Vaadin 20
const items = await endpoint.list();
// Use the double question mark to give a default value in Vaadin 21
const item = (await endpoint.list()) ?? [];
----

Or use `@Nonnull` annotation on the server-side to keep the same code generation behavior as before.

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    @Nonnull
    private Address address;
}
----

.`@Nonnull` annotation
[TIP,role=small]
You can use any `@Nonnull` annotations available or even your own one.
Vaadin uses case-insensitive string comparison for checking the annotation.

See https://vaadin.com/docs/v22/fusion/advanced/endpoints-generator/#type-nullability[Type Nullability] for more details.
