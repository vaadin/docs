==== Input Fields: Removed Support for tabindex > 0

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]

The following general changes have been made to all input field components:

* https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/issues/3275[Removed support for using positive `tabindex` values] (for example, `tabindex=”1”`) on all input field components. 
This will not cause errors but has no effect.
However, setting `tabindex` to `0` or `-1` is still supported.
It is recommended to ensure that input fields are in the correct order in the DOM, instead of overriding the tab order with `tabindex`.

==== Checkbox
* A new `label` property was introduced to set plain text labels in client-side code, and this should be used instead of wrapping the text inside the element tags:

+
[source, html]
----
<!-- Before -->
<vaadin-checkbox>Foo</vaadin-checkbox>

<!-- After -->
<vaadin-checkbox label=”Foo”>
----

* Similarly, rich (HTML) labels should be applied using the new `label` slot:

+
[source,html]
----
<!-- Before -->
<vaadin-checkbox>
  Foo <b>Bar</b>
</vaadin-checkbox>

<!-- After -->
<vaadin-checkbox>
  <label slot=”label”>Foo <b>Bar</b></label>
</vaadin-checkbox>
----

==== Combo Box

* No longer extends `vaadin-text-field`.
* Label, error message and the native input element https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/pull/2496[are now slotted elements] in light DOM instead of inside the component’s shadow DOM.
* https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/pull/2622[Dropped support] for `iron-input` and `paper-input` from `vaadin-combo-box-light`.

<vaadin-radio-button>
  <b>This</b> is a <i>rich</i> label
</vaadin-radio-button>

<vaadin-radio-button>

    <b>This</b> is a <i>rich</i> label
  </label>

----



[discrete]
==== Text Field

* The native `<input>` and `<label>` elements https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/pull/2274[are now slotted children], instead of being inside the component’s shadow DOM.
