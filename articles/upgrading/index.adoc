= Upgrading from Vaadin 23

This guide goes through the changes you'll need to make in your applications when upgrading from Vaadin 23 to the latest version. After these changes, your application should compile, run, behave and look the way it did before you upgraded.

[TIP]
See the https://vaadin.com/docs/v23/upgrading[Vaadin 23 upgrading guide] if you're upgrading from an earlier version.
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.CrossReference = YES -->]

Many of the breaking changes are needed because of the fundamental changes in the Java platform and the major dependencies on which Vaadin relies. This includes the following:

*Servlet 6*::
Vaadin 24 is based on Servlet 6 specifications and is compatible with the Jakarta EE 10. Vaadin encapsulates the usage of the classes from `javax` and `jakarta` packages. Therefore, the application's code doesn't need to use servlets, directly. Nevertheless, this is still needed in various cases, like accessing cookies, setting servlet's parameters, etc.

*Spring Boot 3*::
Vaadin 24 uses the latest Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6 versions. This leads in turn to making breaking changes in Spring-based features compared to earlier Spring-boot 2 and Spring Framework 5 versions.

*Java 17*::
Vaadin 24 requires Java 17 or later, which is dictated by Spring framework and newer versions of application servers.


== Overview

Vaadin 24 doesn't fundamentally change how applications are developed and behave. Still, the upgrade process requires the following essential steps:

* Upgrade the Vaadin version in the project's `pom.xml` file, checking for the latest Vaadin 24 release link:https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases[in GitHub].
* Convert package names to Jakarta EE 10 namespace.
* For Spring-based applications, upgrade to Spring-boot 3 or Spring framework 6, depending on what is used in your project.
* For non-Spring applications, upgrade the application server version to one that's compatible with Jakarta EE 10.
* Upgrade third-party dependencies used in your project (e.g., Maven/Gradle plugins, libraries, frameworks) to the Jakarta and Spring-compatible versions.
* Ensure your application is not using deprecated code fragments.
* Make sure your application runs well on Java 17 runtime.
* Verify that the front-end build works as it should with Vite since webpack is no longer supported.



== Limitations

Portlet and OSGi integrations are not included for two reasons: First, the latest Portlet 3 specification corresponds to Servlet 3, and it doesn't work with Servlet 6. Second, a Jakarta EE 10 compatible version of OSGi core runtime https://felix.apache.org/documentation/index.html[Apache Felix 8] is under development. https://karaf.apache.org/[Apache Karaf] container is based on Apache Felix and doesn't have a Jakarta compatible version.



== Preparation

Upgrade the Vaadin version in the `pom.xml` and `build.gradle` files to the latest release like so:

include::{articles}/_vaadin-version.adoc[]

.pom.xml
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<vaadin.version>{vaadin-version}</vaadin.version>
----

See the link:https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases[list of releases on GitHub] for the latest one.

Since a pre-release is used, you'll have to add the following repositories:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repository>
    <id>vaadin-prereleases</id>
    <url>https://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-prereleases/</url>
</repository>

<pluginRepository>
    <id>vaadin-prereleases</id>
    <url>https://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-prereleases/</url>
</pluginRepository>
----



== Jakarta EE 10 Namespaces

You can use the free tools, the https://github.com/eclipse/transformer[Eclipse transformer] and  the https://github.com/apache/tomcat-jakartaee-migration[Apache migration tool] for the package name conversion. When applied to a project, they'll convert Java class imports, manifests, property files, and other resources to use `jakarta.*` namespace when needed. Conversion instructions are in each tool's `README` file.

The last versions of IntelliJ IDEA offer https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2022.2/migrate.html[migration refactoring] tools, including a Java EE to Jakarta EE package converter. Make sure that the Jakarta specifications in your project have the proper versions. Refer to the full list of https://jakarta.ee/release/10/[Jakarta EE 10 specifications] for more information.

Below are a few examples:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.annotation</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.annotation-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.enterprise</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.enterprise.cdi-api</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.enterprise.concurrent</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.enterprise.concurrent-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----



== Spring Upgrade Instructions

Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6 don't fundamentally change how applications are developed. The main changes are around Jakarta EE 10 namespaces and supported products, Java version and the dependency upgrades and deprecations.

Spring Boot 3 and Framework 6 use new versions of third-party dependencies: Hibernate 6, Hibernate Validator 8, servlet containers (e.g., Jetty 11, Tomcat 10.1) and many others. Spring provides the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Migration-Guide[Dedicated Migration Guide for Spring-boot 3.0] and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Upgrading-to-Spring-Framework-6.x[Upgrading to Spring Framework 6.x Guide].

To browse a full list of changes, see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Release-Notes[Spring-boot 3.0 Release Notes] and the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/What%27s-New-in-Spring-Framework-6.x[What's New in Spring Framework 6.x] page.

Below is a general overview of the changes needed for Spring-based Vaadin applications:

*Upgrade Spring to Latest*

You'll need to upgrade Spring versions to the latest, including the starter parent dependency:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</parent>
----

*Deprecation*

Deprecated `VaadinWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` was removed since Spring no longer has `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` class. Use instead `VaadinWebSecurity` base class for your security configuration. Below is an example of this:

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends VaadinWebSecurity {

    @Override
    public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        // Delegating the responsibility of general configurations
        // of http security to the super class. It's configuring
        // the followings: Vaadin's CSRF protection by ignoring
        // framework's internal requests, default request cache,
        // ignoring public views annotated with @AnonymousAllowed,
        // restricting access to other views/endpoints, and enabling
        // ViewAccessChecker authorization.
        // You can add any possible extra configurations of your own
        // here -- the following is just an example:

        // http.rememberMe().alwaysRemember(false);

        // Configure your static resources with public access before calling
        // super.configure(HttpSecurity) as it adds final anyRequest matcher
        http.authorizeHttpRequests().requestMatchers(
                        new AntPathRequestMatcher("/admin-only/**"))
                .hasAnyRole("admin");
        http.authorizeHttpRequests().requestMatchers(
                        new AntPathRequestMatcher("/public/**"))
                .permitAll();
        super.configure(http);

        // This is important to register your login view to the
        // view access checker mechanism:
        setLoginView(http, LoginView.class);
    }

    @Override
    public void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {
        // Customize your WebSecurity configuration.
        super.configure(web);
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }

    /**
     * Demo UserDetailsManager which only provides two hardcoded
     * in-memory users and their roles.
     * This shouldn't be used in real world applications.
     */
    @Bean
    public UserDetailsService userDetailsService(
            PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) {
        InMemoryUserDetailsManager manager = new InMemoryUserDetailsManager();
        manager.createUser(User.withUsername("user")
                .password(passwordEncoder.encode("userPass"))
                .roles("USER").build());
        manager.createUser(User.withUsername("admin")
                .password(passwordEncoder.encode("adminPass"))
                .roles("USER", "ADMIN").build());
        return manager;
    }
}
----

In this example, `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` -- used in Spring-boot 2.x -- is replaced by `UserDetailsService`. And `http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers()` is replaced by `http.authorizeHttpRequests().requestMatchers()`.



== Java Version

Java 17 or later is required. Below is an example of how to use this version:

[.example]
--
[source,xml]
----
<source-info group="Maven"></source-info>
<properties>
    <java.version>17</java.version>
    <!-- OR: -->
    <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
----
[source,groovy]
----
<source-info group="Groovy"></source-info>
plugins {
    id 'java'
}

java {
    sourceCompatibility = 17
    targetCompatibility = 17
}
----
--



== Application Servers

Before migrating, find the corresponding version of Jakarta EE 10-compatible application server used in your project. See https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/[Jakarta Compatible Products] for more information.

CDI 4.0 specification, which is part of Jakarta EE 10, changes the default value of `bean-discovery-mode` attribute to `annotated` and uses `annotated` as the default when an empty [filename]`beans.xml` file is found in a deployment. See https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/ for more information.

To let the container scan and manage Vaadin components and views when the `bean-discovery-mode` attribute is not defined and the default is used, you should annotate Vaadin components and views with the `com.vaadin.cdi.annotation.CdiComponent` annotation to allow Vaadin components to be detected correctly as CDI beans.

As an alternative, you can set `bean-discovery-mode=all` in the [filename]`beans.xml` file if it's applicable to your project. However, this is not recommended.



== Polymer Templates

Polymer support has been deprecated since Vaadin 18 -- which was released in November 2020 -- in favor of faster and simpler <<{articles}/create-ui/templates#,Lit templates>>. The built-in support for Polymer templates has been removed and is only available for Prime and Ultimate customers via an addon. However, a free conversion tool is also available to assist you in converting your Polymer templates to Lit.


=== Commercial Polymer Template Addon

If you have a Prime or Ultimate subscription, you can continue to use Polymer templates by adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>flow-polymer-template</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Then you'll need to update all imports of the `PolymerTemplate` class to the new coordinates: `com.vaadin.flow.component.polymertemplate.PolymerTemplate`.


=== Free Polymer to Lit Conversion Tool

You can use the free conversion tool to facilitate the migration from Polymer to Lit by automatically converting basic Polymer constructions into their Lit equivalents in Java and JavaScript source files.


==== Limitations

The converter covers only basic cases. More advanced cases, such as TypeScript source files or usage of internal Polymer API, should still be converted manually.

See the https://github.com/vaadin/flow/tree/master/flow-polymer2lit[Polymer-to-Lit converter documentation] for more information about limitations and supported transformations.


==== Usage

Regarding usage, run the converter in your project's root folder as follows:

[.example]
--
[source,text]
----
<source-info group="Maven"></source-info>
mvn vaadin:convert-polymer
----
[source,groovy]
----
<source-info group="Groovy"></source-info>
./gradlew vaadinConvertPolymer
----
--

To convert a project that is based on versions before Vaadin 24, use the following:

[.example]
--
[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
<source-info group="Maven"></source-info>
mvn com.vaadin:vaadin-maven-plugin:{vaadin-version}:convert-polymer
----
.`build.gradle`
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
<source-info group="Groovy"></source-info>
buildscript {
  repositories {
    classpath 'com.vaadin:flow-gradle-plugin:{vaadin-version}'
  }
}
----
--


==== Configuring

The converter will need to be configured. It accepts the following properties:

`-Dvaadin.path=path/to/your/file`::
By default, the converter scans all files that match `**/*.js` and `**/*.java` and then tries to convert them to Lit.
+
To limit conversion to a specific file or directory, you can use the `vaadin.path` property like so:
+
[.example]
--
[source,text]
----
<source-info group="Maven"></source-info>
mvn vaadin:convert-polymer -Dvaadin.path=path/to/your/file
----
[source,text]
----
<source-info group="Groovy"></source-info>
./gradlew vaadinConvertPolymer -Dvaadin.path=path/to/your/file
----
--
+
The path is always relative to your project's root folder.

`-Dvaadin.useLit1`::
By default, the converter transforms Polymer imports into their Lit 2 equivalents.
+
If your project is using Lit 1 (i.e., before Vaadin 21), you can use the vaadin.useLit1 flag to enforce Lit 1 compatible imports:
+
[.example]
--
[source,text]
----
<source-info group="Maven"></source-info>
mvn vaadin:convert-polymer -Dvaadin.useLit1
----
[source,text]
----
<source-info group="Groovy"></source-info>
./gradlew vaadinConvertPolymer -Dvaadin.useLit1
----
--

`-Dvaadin.disableOptionalChaining`::
By default, the converter transforms `\[[prop.sub.something]]` expressions into `${this.prop?.sub?.something}`.
+
If your project is using the Vaadin webpack configuration, which doesn't support the JavaScript optional chaining operator `(?.)`, you can use the `vaadin.disableOptionalChaining` flag like so:
+
[.example]
--
[source,text]
----
<source-info group="Maven"></source-info>
mvn vaadin:convert-polymer -Dvaadin.disableOptionalChaining
----
[source,text]
----
<source-info group="Groovy"></source-info>
./gradlew vaadinConvertPolymer -Dvaadin.disableOptionalChaining
----
--



== Multiplatform Runtime

Multiplatform Runtime allows the use of legacy Vaadin 7 or 8 framework components in Vaadin Flow applications. The Multiplatform Runtime artifacts remain the same: `mpr-v8` and `mpr-v7`. However, the framework server dependencies now contain a `mpr-jakarta` postfix:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<!-- Vaadin 8 -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-server-mpr-jakarta</artifactId>
    <version>8.19.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-compatibility-server-mpr-jakarta</artifactId>
    <version>8.19.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Vaadin 7 -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-server-mpr-jakarta</artifactId>
    <version>7.7.37</version>
</dependency>
----

Other legacy framework dependencies have the same names, but transitive dependencies to `vaadin-server` artifacts must be detected and excluded. Consult <<{articles}/tools/mpr/introduction/1-maven-v8#exclude-incompatible-framework-8-dependency, Exclude Incompatible Framework 8 Dependency>> for further details.



== Maven & Gradle Plugins

Ensure that the Maven plugins which are explicitly defined in your project, are compatible with Java 17. For example, the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin`` requires a minimum version of 1.6.13. Maven version 3.5 and later support Java 17, but avoid using 3.8.2 or 3.8.3. They break redeploy in Jetty.

To run Gradle on top of Java 17, you'll need to use version 7.5 or later. See the https://docs.gradle.org/7.5/release-notes.html[Gradle release notes] for further details. If your project uses Spring Boot, upgrade the plugin `org.springframework.boot` to version 3.0.x.

If you're using a Gradle wrapper, update it to version 7.5 by executing the following from the command-line:

[source,terminal]
----
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.5
----

For Java 17 compatibility, you may need to update the `sourceCompatibility` setting in your project's build file to version 17. Check your project's build file and make any necessary changes.



== SLF4J 2.0

Vaadin 24 and Spring-boot 3 use SLF4J library version 2.0, which has breaking changes compared to earlier versions. See the https://www.slf4j.org/news.html[SLF4J release notes] for more information.


== Breaking Changes in Vaadin Components

Vaadin components have several breaking changes related to upgrading to the latest version.

Badges no longer shrink by default. This can be overridden globally with CSS `[theme~="badge"] { flex-shrink:1; }`, or for specific instances with `badge.getStyle().set("flex-shrink", "1")`, or with `layout.setFlexShrink(badge, 1)`.

Buttons no longer shrink by default. This can be overridden globally with CSS `vaadin-button { flex-shrink:1; }`, or for specific instances with `btn.getStyle().set("flex-shrink", "1")` or with `layout.setFlexShrink(btn, 1)`.

The `CheckboxGroup::setItemLabelGenerator` no longer clears the current selection. The `CheckboxGroup.clear()` can be used to clear value, separately.

The `BlurNotifier<CustomField>` type signature was corrected to `BlurNotifier<CustomField<T>>`.

Date Picker now uses the ISO 8601 date format (`yyyy-mm-dd`) as fallback for unsupported locales, instead of `mm-dd-yyyy`. Time Picker no longer automatically adjusts values to fit min/max constraints.

Number Field's default width now matches that of other text input components. The old default can be brought back with CSS `vaadin-number-field { width:8em; }`.

`RichTextEditor::setvalue` and `getValue` now use HTML format by default, instead of Delta. Applications using the Delta format must be refactored to use the `RichTextEditor.asDelta()` API (e.g. `rte.asDelta().getValue()` and `binder.forField(rte.asDelta())`). To help avoid using the wrong setter, `RichTextEditor.setValue(String)` now throws an exception if the value looks like Delta format (i.e., starts with `[` or `{`). To set an HTML value starting with the above characters, either wrap the value in an HTML tag, or use the `RichTextEditor.asHtml()` API, which doesn't check for them.

The default top and bottom margins of the `H1`...`H6` HTML elements have been removed. This change can be reverted by applying the following CSS:

.styles.css
[source,css]
----
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 { margin-top: 1.25em; }
h1 { margin-bottom: 0.75em; }
h2, h3, h4 { margin-bottom: 0.5em; }
h5 { margin-bottom: 0.25em; }
----


=== Removed Flow Component APIs

.View Removed or Renamed Flow APIs.
[%collapsible]
====
The following Vaadin component APIs have been removed or renamed in Flow:

* The `Generated[ComponentName]` classes have been removed. Extend the normal component classes instead when extending components.
+
The following event classes were introduced in V23.3 as replacements for the ones in the generated classes: `DatePicker.OpenedChangeEvent`, `DatePicker.InvalidChangeEvent`, `Dialog.OpenedChangeEvent`, `Notification.OpenedChangeEvent`, and `SplitLayout.SplitterDragendEvent`.
+
The generic type parameters in these events -- introduced in V23.3 for backward compatibility -- was removed in V24.

* `Button.setDisabled()` removed in favor of `setEnabled(false)`.
* Charts `HTMLLabels` and `HTMLLabelItem` APIs removed (as broken) in favor of `Configuration.addLabel` or `Configuration.setLabels` with `AnnotationItemLabel` objects instead of ``HTMLLabel``s. Coordinate information for the label can be provided using `AnnotationItemLabel.setPoint`.
* `Checkbox::setLabelAsHtml` removed in favor of renderers (i.e., `setRenderer`).
* `CheckboxGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` no longer implement the `HasComponents` and `HasItemComponents` interfaces, and the following methods have been removed:
** `add(Component...)`, `add(Collection)`, and `add(String)`;
** `remove(Component...)`, `remove(Collection)`, and `removeAll()`;
** `addComponentAtIndex(int, Component)`;
** `addComponentAsFirst(Component)`;
** `addComponents(T, Component...)`;
** `prependComponents(T, Component...)`; and
** `getItemPosition(T)`.
* `ContextMenu` `clickListener` API was removed -- it wasn't working. Apply instead click listeners to the menu's target component, if needed.
* `CustomFieldI81n::parseValue` and `CustomFieldI18n::formatValue` moved to `CustomField::parseValue` and `CustomField::formatValue`.
* `DatePickerI18n` setters and getters for `clear`, `.calendar` and `.week` were removed as unused.
* `FlexLayout.getFlexDirection(HasElement elementContainer)` overload was removed -- it was pointless -- in favor of `getFlexDirection()`.
* `Grid::setHeightByRows` was removed in favor of `Grid::setAllRowsVisible`.
* `Grid.addColumn(renderer, sortingProperties)` was removed in favor of `addColumn(renderer).setSortProperty(sortingProperties)`.
* `Grid.ItemClickEvent` and `ItemDoubleClickEvent` without `columnId` were removed.
* `Grid::findInShadowRoot` was removed.
* `Grid::setVerticalScrollingEnabled` was removed: it wasn't working.
* `Map.Coordinate::fromLonLat` was removed as unnecessary since the default coordinate system is now EPSG:4326, and `new Coordinate(x,y)` is sufficient.
* `Map` APIs that used `float` values now use `double`.
* `NumberField::setMaxLength`, `setPattern`, and `setPreventInvalidInput` were removed because they didn't work.
* `NumberField::setHasControls` was renamed `setStepButtonsVisible`.
* `RichTextEditor(String value)` constructor was removed in favor of `RichTextEditor()`, followed by `setValue(String value)`.
* `Select(T... items)` constructor was removed in favor of `Select(String label, T... items)`.
* `SplitLayout.IronResizeEvent` was removed as part of a move away from Polymer.
* `Tabs` no longer implements the `HasComponents` interface and the following APIs were removed or deprecated:
** `add(Collection)` was removed in favor of `add(Tab...)`;
** `remove(Collection)` was removed in favor of `remove(Tab...)`;
** `add(String)` was removed;
** `indexOf(Component)` was deprecated in favor of `indexOf(Tab)`;
** `add(Component)` was deprecated in favor of `add(Tab)`;
** `remove(Component)` was deprecated in favor of `remove(Tab)`;
** `replace(Component, Component)` was deprecated in favor of `replace(Tab, Tab)`;
** `getComponentAt(int)` was deprecated in favor of `getTabAt(int)`;
** `addComponentAtIndex(int, Component)` was deprecated in favor of `addTabAtIndex(int, Tab)`; and
** `addComponentAsFirst(Component)` was deprecated in favor of `addTabAsFirst(Tab)`;
* `TemplateRenderer` public API was removed in favor of `LitRenderer`.
* `TextField::setPreventInvalidInput` was removed in favor of `setAllowedCharPattern`.
* `TimePicker.setMin(String)` and `setMax(String)` were removed in favor of `setMin(LocalTime)` and `setMax(LocalTime)`.
* Upload `SelectedChangeEvent(Tabs source, boolean fromClient)` overload was removed in favor of `SelectedChangeEvent(Tabs source, Tab previousTab, boolean fromClient)`.
* `UploadI18n::setCancel`/`getCancel` was removed since it was unused.

=== Web Component APIs

.Click and Read if Using Vaadin Components without Flow
[%collapsible]
====
The following changes only affect the client-side APIs of Vaadin components:

* The label on `vaadin-checkbox` and `vaadin-radio-button` must be set using the `label` property, as the default slot has been removed.
* `vaadin-confirm-dialog.cancel` and `.reject` properties renamed `.cancelButtonVisible` and `.rejectButtonVisible`.
* `vaadin-number-field` property `has-controls` renamed `step-buttons-visible`.
* Deprecated `@vaadin/vaadin-**` (e.g., `@vaadin/vaadin-grid`) npm packages have been removed. Use the new `@vaadin/**` instead (e.g., `@vaadin/grid`).
* Deprecated `**Element` legacy class aliases (e.g., `GridElement`) have been removed. Use the plain component classes instead (e.g., `Grid`).
* Deprecated misspelled `vaadin-icons` were removed: `buss`, `funcion`, `megafone`, `palete`, and `trendind-down`.
* `notifyResize` and `updateStyles` methods were removed from various components as obsolete.
* `preventInvalidInput` in text input fields was removed in favor of `setAllowedCharPattern`.
* The read-only `theme` _property_ was removed. Use instead the `theme` _attribute_.

== Removed Deprecations

APIs which were deprecated earlier have now been removed. The following linked issue lists the removals:

- https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/15665[Remove deprecated API and tools in Flow 24.0]
