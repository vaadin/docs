= Vaadin 14 to 23 Upgrade Instructions

This is a list of the *necessary changes* you need to make in your application when upgrading it from Vaadin 14 to Vaadin 23, in order to make it compile, run, behave and look the way it did in Vaadin 14.

Note that some of these instructions are only necessary if you are using certain features (such as templates or Spring security) or applying certain techniques (such as custom styling of Vaadin components).

The <<../recommended-changes#,Recommended Changes>> page lists further changes that, while not necessary, are recommended to conform with Vaadin 23 best practices and to avoid the usage of deprecated APIs and features.

== Upgrading From Other Versions

* Upgrading from an intermediate version (for example V20)? Use the <<../upgrade-tool#,Upgrade Guide Generator>> to generate step-by-step instructions from that version.

* Upgrading from a version prior to Vaadin 14? Follow link:https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/upgrading/[the older guides] to upgrade to V14 first, and then continue with this guide.

* You can also use components and views developed with Vaadin 7 or 8 inside an application written for the latest version using <<{articles}/tools/mpr/overview#,Multiplatform Runtime>>.
