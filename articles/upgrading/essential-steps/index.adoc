= Vaadin 14 to 23 Upgrade Instructions

This is a list of the changes you need to make in your application when upgrading it from Vaadin 14 to Vaadin 23, so that it compiles, runs, behaves and looks the way it did in Vaadin 14.

Some of these instructions are only necessary if you are using certain features (such as templates or Spring security) or applying certain techniques (such as custom styling of Vaadin components).

The <<../recommended-changes#,Recommended Changes>> page lists further changes that, although they aren't essential, are recommended to conform with Vaadin 23 best practices and to avoid using deprecated APIs and features.

== Upgrading from Other Versions

* Upgrading from an intermediate version (for example, V20)?
Use the <<../upgrade-tool#,Upgrade Guide Generator>> to generate step-by-step instructions from that version.

* Upgrading from a version before Vaadin 14?
Follow link:/docs/v14/flow/upgrading/[the older guides,role="skip-xref-check"] to upgrade to V14 first, and then continue with this guide.

* You can also use components and views developed with Vaadin 7 or 8 inside an application written for the latest version by using <<{articles}/tools/mpr/overview#,Multiplatform Runtime>>.
