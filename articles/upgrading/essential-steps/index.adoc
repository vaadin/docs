= Vaadin 14 to 23 Upgrade Instructions

This chapter contains the list of changes required to upgrade a Vaadin 14 application to Vaadin 23.
It includes the essential instructions needed for the project to compile, run, and behave in Vaadin 23 as it did in Vaadin 14.

The <<../recommended-changes#,Recommended Changes>> chapter lists further changes that are recommended to conform with Vaadin 23 best practices and to avoid the usage of deprecated APIs and features.

[IMPORTANT]
Before starting the upgrade, be sure to check the list of link:https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases/tag/23.0.0[minimum requirements and supported technologies] for Vaadin 23.

[NOTE]
This guide provides instructions to upgrade from Vaadin 14 to 23 directly.
If you are upgrading between some intermediary versions (for example, between versions 20 and 23), please refer instead to the <<../upgrade-tool#,Upgrade Tool>>.
If you are upgrading from a version prior to Vaadin 14, follow the link:https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/upgrading/[upgrading instructions here] to bring your application to version 14 first, before continuing with this guide.
You can also use applications or components developed with Vaadin 7 or 8 inside an application written using the latest version using <<{articles}/tools/mpr/overview#,Multiplatform Runtime>>.
