
== Before You Start

* Check the list of link:https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases/tag/23.0.0[minimum requirements and supported technologies] for Vaadin 23 to ensure it conforms with your own requirements.

* Check the compatibility of the link:https://vaadin.com/directory/[add-ons] youâ€™re using to see if they work with Vaadin 23.


* Delete the `node_modules` folder and lock file &ndash; either [filename]#package-lock.json# (with `npm`) or [filename]#pnpm-lock.yaml# (with `pnpm`).

* Edit the [filename]#pom.xml# file and change the Vaadin version to the latest-available Vaadin 23 version.

== Update to Java 11+



- The Java version requirement has changed from Java 8 to Java 11 or greater (Java 17 is also supported).
+
For Maven, update `java.version` &ndash;
+
[source, xml]
----
<properties>
    <java.version>11</java.version>
</properties>
----
+
or `compiler.source` and `compiler.target`.
+
[source, xml]
----
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
----

- For Java 9+, the `maven-failsafe-plugin` requires `jaxb-impl` to be added.
+
The dependency can be added directly in the plugin definition, as shown:
+
[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
            <artifactId>jaxb-impl</artifactId>
            <version>${jaxb.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
----

== Update Spring Settings

=== Update Spring Version

Vaadin is compatible with Spring 5.3.18 or later, and Spring Boot 2.6.6 or later.
If your application uses an older version of Spring, update it to a compatible version:

.`pom.xml`
[source, xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.6.6</version>
</parent>
----

Note that upgrading Spring version might require some non-Vaadin-related changes to your application.
Check link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki[Spring Boot release notes] to identify the list of required changes.

.Cyclic dependency in Bakery starter
[NOTE]
====
If your project is based on the link:https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/starters/bakeryflow[V14 Bakery starter] and you encounter an error due to cyclic dependencies after updating the Spring version, it could a result of having an [annotationname]`@Autowired` field of type [classname]`PasswordEncoder` and a method that provides the bean for the same type in the [classname]`SecurityConfiguration` class.

Fix this by moving them to separate classes or, preferably, remove the field in favor of using <<{articles}/flow/integrations/spring/view-based-access-control#, Vaadin Spring Security helpers>>.
====

=== Update Spring Security

If your application uses Spring security, ensure that the [filename]#offline-stub.html# and [filename]#sw-runtime-resources-precache.js# files are added to the list of static resources that are allowed to bypass Spring security.
This can be done by updating [methodname]`WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter.configure(WebSecurity web)` to be similar to the following:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void configure(WebSecurity web) {
    web.ignoring().antMatchers(
            ...

            "/offline-stub.html",
            "/sw-runtime-resources-precache.js",

            ...
    );
}
----

== Enable Server-Side Bootstrapping

Vaadin 23 uses a client-side bootstrapping approach that is different from the server-side mode that is used in Vaadin 14.
This change requires some alteration to your Vaadin 14 codebase.
However, to get your application up and running quickly in Vaadin 23, you can enable Vaadin 14 server-side bootstrapping using the `useDeprecatedV14Bootstrapping` flag.
Later in this guide, we describe the code changes required to use the new bootstrapping mode.

To do this in a Spring project, you can add the following to [filename]#application.properties#:

.`application.properties`
[source]
----
vaadin.useDeprecatedV14Bootstrapping=true
----

Alternatively, if you have a plain Java project, you can enable `useDeprecatedV14Bootstrapping` by adjusting the `vaadin-maven-plugin` configuration in [filename]#pom.xml# as follows:

.`pom.xml`
[source]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <useDeprecatedV14Bootstrapping>true</useDeprecatedV14Bootstrapping>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

To migrate the deprecated server-side bootstrapping to the modern client-side bootstrapping, see the <<../recommended-changes/#bootstrapping-changes, required Bootstrapping Changes>> section.

== Changed APIs

A set of breaking API changes and their replacements are listed below:

- [classname]`AbstractListDataView` now requires an extra constructor argument &ndash; a callback which is invoked each time the component's filter and/or sorting changes through the data view API.
- Property synchronization methods in [classname]`Element` are replaced by a similar API in [classname]`DomListenerRegistration`: [methodname]`getSynchronizedPropertyEvents()`, [methodname]`getSynchronizedProperties()`, [methodname]`removeSynchronizedPropertyEvent()`, [methodname]`removeSynchronizedProperty()`, [methodname]`addSynchronizedPropertyEvent()`, [methodname]`addSynchronizedProperty()`,  [methodname]`synchronizeProperty()`.
- The methods [methodname]`JsModule#loadMode()` and [methodname]`Page#addJsModule(String, LoadMode)` to set the load mode of JsModule have been removed, since they do not work with JavaScript modules.
- The construction methods [methodname]`BeforeEvent(NavigationEvent, Class<?>)` and [methodname]`BeforeEvent(Router, NavigationTrigger, Location, Class<?>, UI)` in [classname]`BeforeEvent` are replaced by [methodname]`BeforeEvent(NavigationEvent, Class, List)` and [methodname]`BeforeEvent(Router, NavigationTrigger, Location, Class, UI, List)`.
-  The methods [methodname]`getUrl()`, [methodname]`getUrlBase()` and [methodname]`getRoutes()` in [classname]`Router` are replaced by the methods [methodname]`getUrl()`, [methodname]`getUrlBase()` and [methodname]`getAvailableRoutes()` in [classname]`RouterConfiguration`.
The [methodname]`resolve()` method in [classname]`Router` is replaced by the [methodname]`resolve()` method in [classname]`RouteUtil`.
The [methodname]`getRoutesByParent()` method in [classname]`Router` is removed and has no replacement.
- [classname]`ServletHelper` is replaced by [classname]`HandlerHelper`.
- The [methodname]`getBodyAttributes()` method in [classname]`AbstractTheme`, [classname]`Lumo` and [classname]`Material` is replaced by [methodname]`getHtmlAttributes()`.
- The [methodname]`removeDataGenerator()` method in [interfacename]`HasDataGenerators` and [classname]`CompositeDataGenerator` is removed in favor of using the registration returned from [methodname]`addDataGenerator(DataGenerator)`.
- The methods [methodname]`preventsDefault()` and [methodname]`stopsPropagation()` in [classname]`ShortcutRegistration` are replaced by [methodname]`isBrowserDefaultAllowed()` and [methodname]`isEventPropagationAllowed()`.
-  The [methodname]`safeEscapeForHtml()` method in [classname]`VaadinServlet` is removed in favor of using [methodname]`org.jsoup.nodes.Entities#escape(String)`.
- The static method [methodname]`getInstance()` in [classname]`ApplicationRouteRegistry` is removed in favor of the instance method.
- The [methodname]`enableInstallPrompt()` parameter of the [annotationname]`@PWA` annotation has been removed without a replacement.
See this https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/8038[GitHub issue] for the motivation for this removal.
- The protected instance method [methodname]`getApplicationUrl()` from [classname]`VaadinServlet` is removed.
- The [interfacename]`HasOrderedComponents`, [interfacename]`HasEnabled`, [interfacename]`HasValidation` and [interfacename]`HasText` interfaces are no longer generic so type parameters should be removed.
- The constructor [methodname]`PlotLine(Number value)` (in Charts) no longer exists.
Use the no-arg constructor and then set the value explicitly with [methodname]`setValue(Number value)` method instead.
- The [annotationname]`@Theme` annotation now takes a <<../recommended-changes#custom-theme-folder,theme folder>> name as its `value` parameter. Use the `themeClass` parameter to specify a theme class instead:

+
[source,java,role="before"]
----
@Theme(Material.class)
----
+
[source,java,role="after"]
----
@Theme(themeClass=Material.class)
----
+
Correspondingly, combined with a theme variant:
+
[source,java,role="before"]
----
@Theme(value=Lumo.class, variant=Lumo.DARK)
----
+
[source,java,role="after"]
----
@Theme(themeClass=Lumo.class, variant=Lumo.DARK)
----


== Miscellaneous Changes

The following features have changes in their behavior, although their APIs are unchanged.

- If necessary, add a `router-ignore` attribute to the anchor elements whose navigation should bypass the Vaadin router.
This is needed, for example, if an anchor is used to log users out in Spring Security.
Without the `router-ignore` attribute, the Vaadin router will intercept the navigation to `/logout`, preventing Spring Security from handling logout as intended.
To fix this, add the `router-ignore` attribute as in the following example:
+
[source, java]
----
Anchor logoutLink = new Anchor("/logout", "Logout from app");
logoutLink.getElement().setAttribute("router-ignore", true);
----

- The <<{articles}/flow/advanced/server-side-modality, server-side modality mechanism>> introduced in V23 changes the behavior of modal Dialogs.

Opening another Dialog when a modal Dialog is already open automatically makes the new Dialog a child of the previously opened one.
Closing the "parent" modal also closes all subsequently opened Dialogs.
To keep other Dialogs open when closing a modal Dialog, add them to the UI explicitly before opening:
+
[source, java]
----
Dialog firstDialog = new Dialog(new Span("First"));
Dialog secondDialog = new Dialog(new Span("Second");

// Add dialogs explicitly to UI
add(firstDialog, secondDialog);

// Later open dialogs
firstDialog.open();
secondDialog.open();
----

- Positive `tabindex` values (such as [methodname]`setTabIndex(5)`) are no longer supported on input fields.
Doing this will not cause errors, but will simply not have any effect on the tab order.
However, `tabindex` values of `0` (to add a tab stop) and `-1` (to remove a tab stop) are still supported.
It is recommended to ensure that input fields are in the correct order in the DOM, instead of overriding the tab order with [methodname]`setTabIndex()`.

- The DOM structure of many components has changed since V14.
While this has no effect on their regular Java APIs, code that utilizes Flow's Element API to access a component's internal elements may be affected.


- For Vaadin Charts, if [classname]`XAxis` or [classname]`YAxis` is added to a chart, the ticks of those axes are now hidden by default.
To display the ticks, provide the axes with a tick width greater than 0 using [methodname]`XAxis.setTickWidth()` and [methodname]`YAxis.setTickWidth()`.


== Update Selenium Version


If your application is based on the `spring-boot-starter-parent` and you use Vaadin TestBench to run integration tests, you need to update the `selenium.version` property in the [filename]#pom.xml# file to `4.X`.
This is to override the outdated Selenium version that gets inherited from the Spring Boot parent.

.`pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <!-- Overrides the old version specified by the Spring Boot parent -->
    <selenium.version>4.1.2</selenium.version>
</properties>
----
