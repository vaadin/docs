////
Upgrading instructions are all loaded to the page as hidden by default.
The upgrade-tool manipulates the visibility of the instructions via their classnames depending of the user's selected options.

This is the description of the classnames:

.all:
    Upgrading instructions that should appear regardless of the user's selected configurations.

.v{from-version}-{to-version}:
    For example, v14-17, will be used by the upgrade tool to show the marked instructions if the user selects to see the instructions for the v14 -> v17 path.
    If there is no upgrading instructions directly for the v14 -> v17 path, the app will then display all the intermediary upgrade paths (i.e. v14->v15, v15->v16, and v16-v17).
    This classname should be added only once above the heading of the upgrading instructions.

.flow:
    Upgrading instructions that should appear if the user selects Flow. When placed under a heading that is marked using the v{from-version}-{to-version} classname, the content
     marked with the flow classname will only appear if the user selects that version. 

.fusion:
.spring:
.typescript:
    Same as flow classname for Fusion, Spring, and TS, respectively.
