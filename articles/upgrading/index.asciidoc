////
Upgrading instructions are all loaded to the page as hidden by default.
The upgrade-tool manipulates the visibility of the instructions via their classnames depending of the user's selected options.

This is the description of the classnames:

.hidden:
    All items should be given this classname for them to be hidden when the page is loaded (the upgrade tool will remove this classname conditional on user selection).

.all:
    Upgrading instructions that should appear regardless of the user's selected configurations.

.flow-all:
    Upgrading instructions that should appear for all Flow projects, regardless of the user's other selected configurations.

.fusion-all:
    Upgrading instructions that should appear for all Fusion projects, regardless of the user's other selected configurations.

.spring-all:
    Upgrading instructions that should appear for all Spring-based projects, regardless of the user's other selected configurations.

.typescript-all:
    Upgrading instructions that should appear for all projects with Typescript views, regardless of the user's other selected configurations.

.flow-{from-version}-{to-version}:
    For example, flow-14-17, will be used by the upgrade tool to show the marked instructions if the user selects to see the instructions for the v14 -> v17 path.
    If there is no upgrading instructions directly for the v14 -> v17 path, the app will then display all the intermediary upgrade paths (i.e. v14->v15, v15->v16, and v16-v17).

.fusion-{from-version}-{to-version}:
    Same as flow-{from-version}-{to-version} for Fusion.

.spring-{from-version}-{to-version}:
    Same as flow-{from-version}-{to-version} for any Spring project (regardless of whether it's flow or fusion based).

.typescript-{from-version}-{to-version}:
    Same as flow-{from-version}-{to-version} for any Typescript project (regardless of whether it's flow or fusion based).

.flow-spring-{from-version}-{to-version}:
    Same as flow-{from-version}-{to-version}, but only displays the content if the project is a Spring-based one.

.flow-typescript-{from-version}-{to-version}:
    Same as flow-{from-version}-{to-version}, but only displays the content if the project is a TypeScript-based one.

.fusion-spring-{from-version}-{to-version}:
    Same as fusion-{from-version}-{to-version}, but only displays the content if the project is a Spring-based one.

.fusion-typescript-{from-version}-{to-version}:
    Same as fusion-{from-version}-{to-version}, but only displays the content if the project is a TypeScript-based one.
