[[ce.production]]
= Taking your app into production

Using Collaboration Engine adds a few extra steps when you <<{articles}/guide/production/production-mode#,take your app to production>>.

You need to:

. obtain a license file with an end-user quota,
. configure where Collaboration Engine files are stored,
. store the license file in the right location and
. implement a `LicenseEventHandler` to be notified when the license needs to be updated.

[[ce.production.obtain-license]]
== Obtain a license file with an end-user quota

First, you need to have a subscription with a large enough user limit to meet your needs.
Vaadin will provide the license file to you.
If you do not have a license yet, https://vaadin.com/collaboration/#contact[request a license via the web page] to get in contact with Vaadin.

The license file name is `ce-license.json`.
It defines how many unique end-users can use collaborative features per month and the license’s expiration date.

[[ce.production.configure-data-dir]]
== Configure where Collaboration Engine files are stored

You need to configure which directory should be used by Collaboration Engine to store files by setting the `vaadin.ce.dataDir` property.
In version 2.0, the only file that Collaboration Engine uses is the `ce-license.json`, but in upcoming versions the directory will be used to e.g. store automatic usage statistics and topic data.
You can configure the directory path by either:

. configuring the data directory in project files or
. passing it in as a parameter on the server startup.

If both are present, then the server startup parameter will be used.

[[ce.production.data-dir-in-project-files]]
=== Configuring the data directory in project files

Storing the path into the project files is a good way if you always deploy your application into the same environment and the folder does not change.
You can set the path as a system property in a `VaadinServiceInitListener`, which runs once on server startup.

==== Spring applications

If you have a Spring application, you can register a `VaadinServiceInitListener` by implementing the interface and annotating
the class as a `@SpringComponent`. In the `serviceInit` method, you can then set `vaadin.ce.dataDir` as a system property.

.com.company.myapp.MyVaadinInitListener.java
```java
@SpringComponent
public class MyVaadinInitListener implements VaadinServiceInitListener {
    @Override
    public void serviceInit(ServiceInitEvent event) {
        System.setProperty("vaadin.ce.dataDir",
                "/Users/steve/vaadin/collaboration-engine/");
    }
}
```

==== Other applications

If you have a non-Spring application, you can implement the `VaadinServiceInitListener` in the same way as seen above,
except that you can't use the `@SpringComponent` annotation.
Instead, you need to register it via Java SPI loading facility.
You do this by providing a file, `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.vaadin.flow.server.VaadinServiceInitListener` with a fully-qualified class name to your listener as content, for example, `com.company.myapp.MyVaadinInitListener`.

image:images/service-init-listener.png[The location of the configuration file]

.src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.vaadin.flow.server.VaadinServiceInitListener
```
com.company.myapp.MyVaadinInitListener
```

=== Configuring the data directory on server startup

As another option, you can pass the data directory as a parameter on server startup.
This option assumes that you have already a production-ready build available and want to run the package on the server.
Read <<{articles}/guide/production/production-mode#,Building in Production Mode>> to learn more about building your application for production.

==== Spring Boot applications

```
java -Dvaadin.ce.dataDir=/Users/steve/.vaadin/collaboration-engine -jar my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Note that the system property should be before the `-jar` parameter.

==== Other servlet containers

You can pass the data directory parameter in as a context parameter to the servlet container.
Refer to your servlet container's manual on how to provide it.
The context parameters that needs to be set is `vaadin.ce.dataDir` and the value should be the directory path.

Here is an example on how you would pass the context parameter in when using Jetty.

```
mvn jetty:run -Dvaadin.ce.dataDir=/Users/steve/vaadin/collaboration-engine/
```

See <<{articles}/flow/advanced/flow-runtime-configuration#,Changing the Application Behavior with Runtime Configuration>> for more information.

The directory should be both readable and writable by the operating system user running the Vaadin application.

[[ce.production.files-to-server]]
== Store the license file in the right location

After obtaining the license file and the data directory, you need to put the license file in that directory on the server.
For example, if you configured the folder to be `/Users/steve/vaadin/collaboration-engine/`, then place the license file so that `/Users/steve/vaadin/collaboration-engine/ce-license.json` can be read by the application.

Collaboration Engine will use the file to verify you have a proper license.
The app does not require an internet connection to Vaadin servers to verify the license.

== Providing a data directory for a Docker container
It is recommended to provide the data directory to a Docker container on runtime by either using a https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/[volume] or a https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/[bind mount].
It is not recommended to copy the license file into the container image, as the data directory will be erased every time you deploy a new version of your application.

If you are deploying to a cloud provider, the odds are that you do not have access to the host file system to be able to make use of bind mounts.
Consult the documentation for your cloud provider to get instructions on how to set up and provide a volume to your application.

While a volume is preferred, if you have access to the host's file system or want to test the Docker image locally, you can do it with a bind mount with the following steps:

1. Set up a data directory on the host's file system. For example `/Users/steve/.vaadin/collaboration-engine`.
2. Copy the `ce-license.json` file into the folder above.
3. Pick a suitable folder within your Docker image where the host folder will be mounted. For example `/usr/app/ce`.
4. Configure your `Dockerfile` to start up the server with the `vaadin.ce.dataDir` parameter pointing to the internal folder. For example `CMD java -Dvaadin.ce.dataDir=/usr/app/ce -jar /usr/app/app.jar`
5. Build the Docker image, for example `$ docker build --tag my-app .` in the project directory.
6. Start up the Docker container by giving the `-v` parameter mapping the host folder to the image folder. For example `$ docker run --name=myapp -dp 8080:8080 -v /Users/steve/.vaadin/collaboration-engine:/usr/app/ce myapp`

When using volumes, you would replace the absolute path to the directory with the name of the volume, for example
```
$ docker run --name=myapp -dp 8080:8080 -v myapp-volume:/usr/app/ce myapp
```


[[ce.production.license-events]]
== Getting notified when license needs to be updated

The licensing model may cause collaborative features to be disabled for some of
your application's users. To avoid this situation, you need to obtain a new license
if your old license is about to expire, or if your user base increases and the
number of monthly end-users exceeds the quota.

To know when to update the license, you need to implement a license event handler for Collaboration Engine.
There are four different license event types, each fired at most once during the license's lifecycle:

. the first time when exceeding the end-user quota and entering the grace period (more details in <<ce.production.over-quota>>),
. when the grace period ends,
. 30 days before the license expires and
. when the license expires.

If you take care of updating the license when events 1 and 3 are fired, the other
two events shouldn't happen at all.

One potential way to handle the event is to send a message to any existing application monitoring system you might have.
Another option is to send an email to the relevant people, e.g. those who maintain
the deployment and those who are responsible of the Collaboration Engine license.
The important thing is to make sure that the events are noticed and properly handled.

The listener can be configured in a `VaadinServiceInitListener` in the same way as the `vaadin.ce.dataDir` property,
if you're setting that property in Java code, as described earlier.
In the following example we have a Spring project, so the `VaadinServiceInitListener`
is registered by adding the `@SpringComponent` annotation.
If you're not using Spring, you can register the service init listener
in the same way as described in <<ce.production.data-dir-in-project-files>>.

```java
@SpringComponent
public static class MyVaadinInitListener
        implements VaadinServiceInitListener {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory
            .getLogger(MyVaadinInitListener.class);

    @Override
    public void serviceInit(ServiceInitEvent serviceEvent) {
        VaadinService service = serviceEvent.getSource();

        LicenseEventHandler licenseEventHandler = licenseEvent -> {
            switch (licenseEvent.getType()) {
            case GRACE_PERIOD_STARTED:
            case LICENSE_EXPIRES_SOON:
                LOGGER.warn(licenseEvent.getMessage());
                break;
            case GRACE_PERIOD_ENDED:
            case LICENSE_EXPIRED:
                LOGGER.error(licenseEvent.getMessage());
                break;
            }
            sendEmail(
                    "Vaadin Collaboration Engine license needs to be updated",
                    licenseEvent.getMessage());
        };

        CollaborationEngineConfiguration configuration = new CollaborationEngineConfiguration(
                licenseEventHandler);
        CollaborationEngine.configure(service, configuration);
    }

    private void sendEmail(String subject, String content) {
        // Implement sending an email to relevant people
    }
}
```

In this example, we are logging the event messages using SLF4J logging API, as well as sending an email.
When it's time to update the license, the message is logged as a warning.
If the license is not updated in time, the message is logged as an error.
The default event messages provide information of what has happened,
how it will affect the application, and what is the recommended action to take.

Below is an example implementation of the `sendEmail` method.
It requires the `javax.mail.mail` package as a dependency.
```java
private void sendEmail(String subject, String content) {
    // Replace the following information:
    String from = "sender@gmail.com";
    String password = "*****"; // Read e.g. from encrypted config file
    String to = "receiver@gmail.com";
    String host = "smtp.gmail.com";

    Properties properties = System.getProperties();
    properties.put("mail.smtp.host", host);
    properties.put("mail.smtp.port", "465");
    properties.put("mail.smtp.ssl.enable", "true");
    properties.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");

    Session session = Session.getInstance(properties, new Authenticator() {
        @Override
        protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
            return new PasswordAuthentication(from, password);
        }
    });
    try {
        MimeMessage message = new MimeMessage(session);
        message.setFrom(new InternetAddress(from));
        message.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO,
                new InternetAddress(to));
        message.setSubject(subject);
        message.setText(content);
        Transport.send(message);
    } catch (MessagingException e) {
        LOGGER.error(e.getMessage(), e);
    }
}
```

NOTE: Collaboration Engine will throw an exception in production mode if a configuration hasn't been defined.
The purpose is to make sure that you're aware of the events,
and to avoid accidentally forgetting to monitor the license status.

[[ce.production.monthly-quota]]
== Monthly end-user quota

Your license includes a quota for how many end-users are supported, for example, a limit of 1.000 end-users.
Collaboration Engine counts how many end-users use its features during each calendar month.
The count of end-users will start over on the 1st of each month.

[[ce.production.end-user]]
== Definition of an end-user

When you use any Collaboration Engine features, you have to provide a `UserInfo` object with a unique ID.

```java
String userId = "steve@example.com";
String name = "Steve";
UserInfo userInfo = new UserInfo(userId, name);
CollaborationAvatarGroup avatarGroup = new CollaborationAvatarGroup(
        userInfo, "app");
add(avatarGroup);
```

Collaboration Engine records the ID of each user that accesses collaborative features in the ongoing month and counts towards your quota for the current month.
Each user ID is counted only once per month.

[[ce.production.over-quota]]
== What happens if I go over the quota?

When you exceed the limit the first time, nothing will change from the end-user's perspective.
Collaboration Engine will start a 30 day grace period, during which the quota is ten times bigger.
The grace period gives you time to react to exceeding your limit without impacting your application in any way.
For example, if you have obtained a license for a 500 end-user quota, your effective quota will be 5.000 end-users during the grace period.
After 30 days, your effective quota will go back to 500, and you won’t get another grace period until the next billing period.

If the number of monthly users exceeds the 10x quota during the grace period, or the normal quota after the grace period is over, the collaborative features will be disabled for the exceeding users.
Your app will still continue to work, but `CollaborationAvatarGroup` will only show the user's own avatar, and forms built with `CollaborationBinder` will not show edits made by other end-users.
The end-users who are registered within the allowed quota will have collaborative features available throughout the month.

For example, you have a quota for 500 end-users, you have used your grace period, and 520 end-users have used collaborative features this month.
The first 500 end-users can collaborate throughout the month. Users 501-520 can use the app, but the app will work like Collaboration Engine would not be in use. They can only see their own presence and edits.
When the calendar month changes, counting starts over, and the first 500 end-users will again get full access for the whole month.

[[ce.production.when-in-grace]]
== What should I do when I have entered the grace period?

It seems that you have a higher demand than expected when obtaining the license.
We recommend that you get a new license with a higher quota to have collaborative features available for all your users before the grace period expires.
https://vaadin.com/collaboration/#contact[Contact Vaadin] to get a new license file with a higher quota.
You can change your quota at any point in time.
When you replace the license file with the new one, Collaboration Engine will mark your grace period as unused.
If you exceed your new quota in the future, you will receive a new 30 day grace period.

[[ce.production.request-access]]
== Can I know if an end-user currently has access and act accordingly?

Yes. The `CollaborationEngine` instance has the `requestAccess` method, which provides a way to know if an end-user has access.
It takes a callback that will be invoked when access has been checked. Within the callback, based on `AccessResponse::hasAccess` you act accordingly, e.g., adapting the UI
depending on the fact that the end-user can use collaborative features.

An example of how to check if an end-user has access:
```java
UserInfo userInfo = new UserInfo("steve@example.com", "Steve");
CollaborationEngine.getInstance().requestAccess(userInfo, response -> {
    component.setVisible(response.hasAccess());
});
```

[[ce.production.restrict-usage]]
== Can I restrict collaborative features to a subset of my end-users?

Yes. Collaboration Engine will only count those end-users whose `UserInfo` objects are passed to collaborative features. You can limit usage to a subset of your users in two different ways.

. Only use Collaboration Engine in views that you have restricted with user access. For example, if you only use collaborative features in the admin views, only those users who access the admin views will be counted.
. Check the details of the user before initializing the collaboration features. For example, by checking the role or privileges or the user, you can decide in code if the users should have collaborative features enabled or not.

An example of how to enable collaboration by checking user permissions:
```java
User userEntity = userService.getCurrentUser();
if (userEntity.getRoles().contains(Role.ADMIN)) {
    UserInfo userInfo = new UserInfo(userEntity.getId(),
            userEntity.getName(), userEntity.getImageUrl());

    CollaborationAvatarGroup avatarGroup = new CollaborationAvatarGroup(
            userInfo, "avatars");

    add(avatarGroup);
}
```
