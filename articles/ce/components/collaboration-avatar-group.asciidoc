= Indicating User Presence With Collaboration Avatar Group

Collaboration Engine includes an extension to Vaadin's `AvatarGroup` component,
called `CollaborationAvatarGroup`.
It automatically updates the displayed avatars based on the users who are
currently present in a view.
More specifically, when `CollaborationAvatarGroup` is attached,
the user's avatar will be added to the group for all users.
When the component becomes detached, often because of navigating to another view or closing the browser tab,
the user's avatar is removed from the group.


.Example of a `CollaborationAvatarGroup`
image::images/collaboration-avatar-group-example.png["Three avatars in a group, with three more avatars collapsed to an overflow item", 153]

To get started with `CollaborationAvatarGroup`, provide the `UserInfo` that represents
the current active user and the id of the topic to connect to.
Then add the component to your view:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/AvatarGroupDocumentation.java[tags=avatar-group-new,indent=0]
----

.`User`, `UserService` and `"ensuranceClaims"` are examples
[NOTE]
The `User` and `UserService` classes are not available in Collaboration Engine.
They are examples of classes that might exist in your application for user management.
The topic ID `"ensuranceClaims"` can be any string to identify what the users are collaborating on.

After running the app and opening the view, you should see your own avatar.
Try opening the view in another browser tab at the same time, as a separate user entity
(distinguished by the id provided to `UserInfo`).
Both tabs should display the avatars of both users.

[[ce.configuring-avatars]]
== Configuring the Avatars

The avatars are mostly configured through the `UserInfo` object.
When no other information is available, the avatar displays a generic icon.

=== Name and Abbreviation

When a user name is provided via `UserInfo::setName`,
an automatically generated abbreviation will be displayed in the avatar.
To display a custom abbreviation, `UserInfo::setAbbreviation` can be used.
Hovering the mouse over the avatar displays the full name in a tooltip.
The name is also presented in the overflow dropdown;
when all of the avatars don't fit into the group,
the last avatar, which has text such as "+3", can be clicked to show
the overflowing avatars and names in a dropdown.

=== Loading Images From a URL

To display an image inside the avatar, there are two options.
First of all, if the image is already hosted somewhere,
you can provide its URL as a string to `UserInfo::setImage`.
Note that setting an image is not a replacement for the `name` property.
When an image is provided, `name` is still displayed in a tooltip on hover
and in the overflow dropdown.

=== Loading Images From a Backend

The way to load images from a database to components such as `Image` or `Avatar`
with Vaadin is to use `StreamResources`.
`CollaborationAvatarGroup` supports stream resources with the `setImageProvider` method.
It takes a function that generates `StreamResources` for users based on their `UserInfo`.
For example, if the user entity contains the image as a byte array,
you can create a `StreamResource` that loads those bytes and let the framework take care
of hosting the image:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/AvatarGroupDocumentation.java[tags=avatar-group-images,indent=0]
----

The explanation for this image provider pattern is,
that `StreamResource` is not serializable as JSON,
so it can't be included in `UserInfo` and sent back and forth
through Collaboration Engine.

== Scoping the Avatars With Topics

Using different topic ids in the `setTopic()` method allows defining which users
can see each others' avatars in the group.
If everyone in the view should see each other in the same avatar group,
the topic id can be any constant string,
as long as it doesn't conflict with potential other avatar groups in other views.
For example, the view name could be used as the topic id in this case.

In many cases, the same `CollaborationAvatarGroup` component should be re-used for
different topics.
Think about a form view that is used for editing different entities,
where you want to see only the avatars of the users who are editing the same entity.
In this case, the topic id should be specific to the edited entity.
For example, consider a form for editing different `Person` entities.
When selecting the entity to edit, the topic could be updated as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/AvatarGroupDocumentation.java[tags=avatar-group-topic,indent=0]
----

If the form uses `CollaborationBinder`, it makes sense to use the same topic id
for the binder and the avatar group.

Setting `null` topic disables the connection to Collaboration Engine.
The group won't display any avatars until a non-null topic id is provided.

== Displaying User's Own Avatar Separately

It's a common design pattern to display the user's own avatar somewhere separately
from the group of collaborators' avatars.
To achieve this, you can exclude the user's own avatar from the `CollaborationAvatarGroup`
and create a separate `Avatar` component.
You can then add it anywhere in your view, independently of the other avatars.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/AvatarGroupDocumentation.java[tags=avatar-group-own,indent=0]
----

You can set the same `name`, `abbreviation` and `image` properties as for the `UserInfo`.
To load the image from a backend, you can pass a `StreamResource` directly
to the `Avatar::setImageResource` method.
