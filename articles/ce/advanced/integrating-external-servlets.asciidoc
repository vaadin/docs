= Obtaining a Collaboration Engine Instance in a Servlet

When a [classname]#VaadinService# instance is not available, it is impossible to obtain a [classname]#CollaborationEngine# instance with the [methodname]#getInstance()# method.
In a servlet, the instance can be obtained with the [methodname]#getAttribute()# method, as long as it has been configured.
Please refer to <<{articles}/ce/going-to-production#other-applications, Other Applications>> in production configuration documentation for details on how to configure Collaboration Engine.
