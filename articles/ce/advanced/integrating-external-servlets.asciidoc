= Obtaining a Collaboration Engine instance in a servlet

When a [classname]#VaadinService# instance is not available, it's not possible to obtain a [classname]#CollaborationEngine# instance through the [methodname]#getInstance# method. In a servlet, the instance can be obtained through the [methodname]#getAttribute# method, as long as it has been initialized.
