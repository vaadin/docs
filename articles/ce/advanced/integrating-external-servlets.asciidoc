= Obtaining a Collaboration Engine Instance in a Servlet

When a [classname]`VaadinService` instance is not available, it is impossible to obtain a [classname]`CollaborationEngine` instance with the [methodname]`getInstance()` method.
In a servlet, the instance can be obtained with the [methodname]`getAttribute()` method, as long as it has been configured.
Please refer to <<{articles}/ce/going-to-production#other-applications, Other Applications>> in production configuration documentation for details on how to configure Collaboration Engine.
