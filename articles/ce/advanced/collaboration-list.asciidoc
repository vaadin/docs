= Store ordered values in Topics

The Topic API provides the [classname]#CollaborationList# data structure to store ordered values and subscribe to their changes.

A [classname]#CollaborationList# can be obtained by its name in the Topic connection activation callback.

----

When you have obtained the list instance, you can insert values at the end of the list with the [methodname]#insertLast()# method.

[source,java]

include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/CollaborationListExample.java[tags=result;!future;!key,indent=0]
----

Since the insertion is asynchronous, the method returns a result object from which you can get a [classname]#CompletableFuture# that you can use to determine when the insertion has been done.

The result object also provides the `ListKey` of the inserted item, which you can use to replace the item itself or get its current value.
