= Collaborative Form Editing with CollaborationBinder

The recommended way of binding data from Java beans to forms in Vaadin applications is to use `Binder`

Collaboration Engine provides a `Binder` extension called `CollaborationBinder`,
which adds the following real-time features on top of the binder's data binding and validation APIs:

* Field value synchronization: When a user enters a new value to a field, the value is updated for the other users as well.
* Field highlight: When a user is focused on a field, other users see a highlight around the field and his/her user name indicating that he/she is currently editing it.

== Constructing a CollaborationBinder

The constructor of `CollaborationBinder` requires the bean type to bind values to,
similarly to the regular `Binder` when binding by property names.
As the second argument, you must provide some information about the end user.
The same `UserInfo` object is required by all Collaboration Engine features.
`CollaborationBinder` uses the name in `UserInfo`, when indicating
that another user is editing a field with the field highlight.
[source, java]
----
User userEntity = userService.getCurrentUser();

UserInfo userInfo = new UserInfo(userEntity.getId(),
        userEntity.getName());

CollaborationBinder<Person> binder = new CollaborationBinder<>(
        Person.class, userInfo);
----

== Connecting to Collaboration Engine and Populating the Form

The `CollaborationBinder::setTopic` method  serves two purposes:

1. Connecting to Collaboration Engine in the scope of the edited item
2. Populating the form with initial values loaded from a backend

Here is an example use case. When selecting an item to edit (an instance of `Person` bean class in this case),
`setTopic` is used to connect to the topic and to populate the form:
[source, java]
----
public void personSelected(long personId) {
    binder.setTopic("person/" + personId,
            () -> personService.findById(personId));
}
----

The first parameter is the id of the topic to connect to. By using unique topic ids for different
items, we make sure that edits on different items don't interfere with each other.

The second parameter is a callback for providing the bean that populates the fields.
The regular `Binder` has the `readBean` method for populating the fields based on bean properties.
This method is not supported by `CollaborationBinder`. The reason is, that calling `readBean`
when a new view instance is constructed would have an unwanted effect:
Every time a new user would join editing the form, the field values would reset for every user.
The `setBean` method is unsupported for the same reason.

The callback provided for `setTopic` replaces `readBean`.
It will be used to populate the form if the topic doesn't have any data yet,
i.e. the user is the first one to edit that form.
Otherwise, the field values are loaded from the topic in Collaboration Engine.
In this case, the callback is not even called, possibly avoiding an unnecessary database request.

NOTE: If you explicitly want to override all field values for all collaborators (e.g. implement a reset button),
you can use `CollaborationBinder::reset` method, which takes a bean instance and uses its properties for
setting the field values.

== Binding Collaborative Fields

Here is an example of how we can bind the `Person` bean's `name` property to a text field,
enabling also the collaborative features (value synchronization and field highlight):

[source, java]
----
TextField name = new TextField();
binder.forField(name).bind("name");
----

You could write exactly the same code with the regular `Binder`.
`CollaborationBinder` just adds the collaborative features on top of the regular data binding.
Note that binding based on a property name ("name" in this case) requires the bean class (`Person`)
to have standard getter and setter methods `getName` and `setName`.

The other `bind` variant, which takes the getter and setter callbacks as arguments, is not supported
by `CollaborationBinder`. The technical reason for this is, that some unique key is needed
per each field/property to store the data in the underlying `CollaborationMap` data structure.
The property name is required for that purpose, to be used as the key.

Because the data used to communicate with Collaboration Engine is serialized as JSON, there are some limitations
to what `CollaborationBinder` can do automatically.
Next, we'll cover the special cases where you need to do a little bit more than
simply binding a property to a field.

=== Non-Primitive Value Types

Collaboration Engine supports only a limited set of primitive-like value types,
that it knows how to serialize and deserialize.
When using some other field value type, you must explicitly provide the serializer
and deserializer functions.

When the field is used for selecting a bean object that has a unique identifier,
you can serialize the value by converting the bean to its identifier, and deserialize
by fetching the bean object that matches the id.

In this example, the `Person` bean that we are editing, has a reference to the person's
supervisor, which is another `Person`. We'll use a `ComboBox` component for selecting
the person's supervisor:
[source, java]
----
ComboBox<Person> supervisor = new ComboBox<>();
supervisor.setItems(personService.findAllSupervisors());

binder.setSerializer(Person.class,
        person -> String.valueOf(person.getId()),
        id -> personService.findById(Long.parseLong(id)));

binder.bind(supervisor, "supervisor");
----
The person ids are stored as `longs` in this case, and the serialized value needs to be a `String`.
In this case, we need to do a bit of converting between strings and longs.

=== Converters

When a `Converter` is used, you must provide the field's value type in `forField`.

In this example, we are binding an enum property of the bean to a `Checkbox`,
so the checkbox's value type `boolean` needs to be provided:
[source, java]
----
Checkbox married = new Checkbox();
binder.forField(married, Boolean.class)
        .withConverter(
                fieldValue -> fieldValue ? MaritalStatus.MARRIED
                        : MaritalStatus.SINGLE,
                MaritalStatus.MARRIED::equals)
        .bind("maritalStatus");
----
This is necessary, because `CollaborationBinder` uses the bean
property type (`MaritalStatus` enum in this case) for deserializing
the field value by default.

=== Multi Select Fields

When the field's value type is a collection,
you must provide the type of the collection as well as the
type of its contents in `forField`.

For example, the value type of `CheckboxGroup` is `Set`.
In the example below, we must provide the collection type `Set` and the content type `String`.
[source, java]
----
CheckboxGroup<String> pets = new CheckboxGroup<>();
pets.setItems("Dog", "Cat", "Parrot");

binder.forField(pets, Set.class, String.class).bind("pets");
----
This is necessary, because `CollaborationBinder` can't automatically infer the
generic type for deserializing the value.
Note that if the element type is not supported by Collaboration Engine (e.g. `CheckboxGroup<Person>`),
you need to implement custom (de)serializer functions anyway.

== Propagate Values Eagerly in Text Fields
On text fields, the default and recommended mode for propagating values from one user to others are when the user blurs the field. 
However, in some use cases you might want to send the value of the field more eagerly. 
You can configure how eagerly the data should be sent through the text fields own API, `TextField.setValueChangeMode(ValueChangeMode);`.
For example, to instantly send each keystroke to other users, you would do the following:

[source, java]
----
textField.setValueChangeMode(ValueChangeMode.EAGER);
----

Modes like `ValueChangeMode.LAZY` and `ValueChangeMode.TIMEOUT` can also be used together with `textField.setValueChangeTimeout(int);` to reduce the amount of traffic.
