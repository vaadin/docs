Collaboration Engine is licensed under the https://vaadin.com/license/cvrl-1.0[Commercial Vaadin Runtime License (CVRL)].
You can try Collaboration Engine out and develop applications with it without charge.
When you take your application to production, you need a valid subscription.
To get started, follow the <<tutorial#,tutorial on adding Collaboration Engine to your project>> to learn about the features.

While your application is in development mode, you can use all the features of Collaboration Engine without restrictions.
You do not need a development license or a separate trial.
Development mode is the default mode of a Vaadin application and is used when not explicitly configured to do a production build.
