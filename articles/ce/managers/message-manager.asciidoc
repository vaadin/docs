[[ce.message-manager]]
= Send and Receive Messages Programmatically

Collaboration Engine includes a message manager to handle text messages in a topic.
You can use it, for example, for subscribing to incoming messages and submitting new messages programmatically.
The manager can also be configured to persist messages to a custom backend, such as a database, so that the messages are restored when the application restarts.
It provides a flexible way to manage messages in a topic and helps create custom components with collaborative messaging features.

== Handling Messages Sent to a Topic

To handle messages sent to a topic, you need to create a [classname]#MessageManager# instance for the topic and then set a [classname]#MessageHandler# with [methodname]#setMessageHandler()#.
Once set, the handler is first invoked for all the messages already in the topic and later for each new message submitted to the topic.
The handler can be expressed as a lambda that gets a [classname]#MessageContext# instance, which provides access to the [classname]#CollaborationMessage# containing all the details of the submitted message.

The following example shows how to create a new [classname]#MessageManager# instance and receive messages for a given topic:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/MessageManagerExample.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

<1> The manager is constructed with a component instance, the local user-info, and the topic ID.

<2> The [methodname]#setMessageHandler()# method takes a callback that will be invoked when a new message is submitted.
The message is provided by the context passed as the argument to the callback.

== Submitting New Messages to a Topic

You can submit a new message to a topic by using [methodname]#submit()# in [classname]#MessageManager#.
It has two overloads: one that takes the message text as a string and submits it to the associated topic with the local user as the author of the message and with the current timestamp; the other takes a [classname]#CollaborationMessage# instance where you can explicitly set the message details.

The following example uses the [classname]#MessageManager# instance created earlier to broadcast notifications to all users connected to the same view:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/MessageManagerExample.java[tags=submit,indent=0]
----

The above example uses the [classname]#MessageInput# component to input messages, and handles them in a submit listener.


.Compatibility with [classname]#CollaborationMessageList#
NOTE: If a [classname]#MessageManager# instance is using the same topic ID of a xref:../components/collaboration-message-list#ce.collaboration-message-list[`CollaborationMessageList`], messages submitted with the manager will also appear on the list.

[[ce.message-manager.persister]]
== Persisting Messages

The data in Collaboration Engine is by default stored only in the application memory.
This applies also to messages handled by [classname]#MessageManager#, which means that all the messages will be lost when the server is restarted.

To make the messages persistent, you need to configure [classname]#MessageManager# to store the messages in your own backend.
It requires implementing the [classname]#CollaborationMessagePersister# interface.

The interface specifies two operations:

- Store a new message.
- For a given topic, fetch all messages that have been submitted during or after a given timestamp.

In the following example implementation, you can see how the persister is mapping between the [classname]#CollaborationMessage# objects and the application's own [classname]#Message# entities, as well as integrating with the service layer:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/MyMessagePersister.java[tags=message-persister,indent=0]
----
<1> In the example, [classname]#MessageService#, [classname]#UserService#, [classname]#Message#, and [classname]#User# are application-specific example classes, and not part of the Collaboration Engine API.

.Initialize a persister from lambdas
TIP: You can also create a message persister instance with lambdas by using the static [methodname]#CollaborationMessagePersister.fromCallbacks()# method.

It is best to configure your database to insert the creation/insertion timestamp of the entity.
This ensures that the messages are ordered by their timestamps in the database.
If you use the timestamp provided by [methodname]#CollaborationMessage::getTime()# (based on the JVM clock), you take a risk of skipping some inserted messages in rare edge cases.

For example, if you use Hibernate to create the database table, you can include an automatic insertion timestamp in your entity class with the following annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Column(columnDefinition="TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP")
private Instant time;
----

You can set the message persister in the manager's constructor:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/MessageManagerExample.java[tags=persister,indent=0]
----

When a persister is provided, [classname]#MessageManager# takes care of keeping the component state in sync with your backend.
When the first manager connects to a topic after starting the application, it fetches all the messages from the persister (making a [classname]#FetchQuery# with the Unix epoch as the [methodname]#getSince()# timestamp).
The fetched messages are stored in Collaboration Engine's memory and shared among other managers connected to the same topic, avoiding redundant backend queries.

When a new message is submitted, the data flows through your backend.
First, the manager saves the message to your backend with the persister.
Then, the manager makes a query to the persister to fetch all the messages with a timestamp that is equal or more recent than the last message in memory.
The new messages are again stored in the Collaboration Engine's memory, updating all the manager instances that are connected to the same topic.

When implementing the [methodname]#fetchMessages()# method, it is important to note that the returned stream should include the messages sent exactly at the time that you can get with [methodname]#getSince()# from the [classname]#FetchQuery#.
This ensures that all messages are fetched even when multiple messages have the same timestamp.
The component takes care of filtering out the duplicates, which are expected when returning the latest message again.
