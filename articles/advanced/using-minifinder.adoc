= Preparing for Upgrade with Minifinder for Eclipse 

*Minifinder for Eclipse* is a tool built by Vaadin to help Vaadin 8 developers understand how well their applications can be transformed into the latest Vaadin version by Vaadin’s semi-automated modernization service called https://vaadin.com/vaadin-8-upgrade-automation-service[V8 Upgrade Automation]. 

It works by parsing the Java code in your project resolving as many of your application’s references to Vaadin libraries as it can, and outputting the high-level results in the Eclipse IDE console.

You can copy the report and share it with your colleagues or your Vaadin experts, to discuss the benefits, and make an informed decision on whether to move on with V8 Upgrade Automation.


== Limitations

To make Minifinder as easy as possible to be used at companies with strict security policies on installing tools in their network, the application is limited:

* Minifinder runs locally and does not connect to the internet;
* It doesn't not change your code;
* It writes all output to console instead of disk.

== Using Minifinder for Eclipse

To use Minifinder with Eclipse:

1. Ensure Eclipse is ready to use the plugin;
2. Ensure your application projects are ready to be analyzed;
3. Run the analyzer;
4. Interpret the results.


=== 1. Ensure Eclipse is Ready

Minifinder is distributed as a single-file Eclipse plugin JAR that you can copy into the Eclipse `/plugins` or `/dropins` folder from which you open your Vaadin 8 project. You may need to restart Eclipse after copying the file. you will then see a button with a Vaadin logo, i.e. `]>`, appear in your toolbar.

.Latest Version
[NOTE]
Always make sure that you have the most up to date version of Minifinder because it contains the latest set of transformation rules that are available with the V8 Upgrade Automation.

=== 2. Ensure Your Application Projects Are Ready

Minifinder depends on the Eclipse environment to resolve all names in your code with their corresponding types and packages in which they are declared. Eclipse is robust and can resolve names in sources that contain errors -- Minifinder may work even if your project has hundreds of Maven or Java errors. 
However, the fewer errors you have the better, so it's still recommended that you ensure your project is free of red lines before launching Minifinder.

You may consider closing any project in your workspace of which doesn't contain any Vaadin 8 references. This prevents Minifinder from analyzing irrelevant code and shave off minutes from the analysis.


=== 3. Run the Analyzer

Click the button, i.e. the Vaadin logo, in the toolbar that appeared after you installed the plugin. The tool is set up with default settings that work with over 97% of all Vaadin 8 applications. Press [guilabel]`OK` to proceed with the analysis.

A progress bar appears and shows progress.

=== 4. Interpret Results

After the progress bar reaches 100% and disappears, the analysis is completed and you can view the output. Minifinder for Eclipse puts writes output in the Eclipse Console. 

[menuseq]`Window > Show View > Console`

The report is a text-only and it summarizes statistics on the references in the project code to Vaadin 8. Emphasis is on _method invocations_ and _constructor invocations_: 

1. Method invocations are invocations that appear in the project code within methods that are declared in Vaadin 8 classes.

2. Constructor invocations are new keywords that are matched with constructors that are declared in Vaadin 8 classes.

Both of these invocations are included in the statistics if the method or constructor invoked is declared in a Vaadin class. This means that invocations on custom subclasses of Vaadin components in your project will be included in the statistics if the method is inherited from its Vaadin super class. furthermore, invocations on custom subclasses in your project will not be included in the statistics if the methods invoked are declared in your own custom subclass. 

The stats for method and constructor invocations include an indication of coverage. The higher the coverage rate the better. Coverage refers to a situation that is known and is dealt with high confidence that no further developer work is required. In other words:

* The transformation has been established for this declaration and the transformation tool contains a rule that handles it, and;
* The transformation requires no change, or;
* The transformation requires a change and this change is made by the tool with no manual effort required

Coverage assumes that the modernized application uses link:/docs/latest/advanced/classic-components[Classic Components] and a handful of utility methods that help bridge the gap in behavior between Vaadin 8 and later versions.
