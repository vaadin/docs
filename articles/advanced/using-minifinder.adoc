= Preparing for Upgrade with Minifinder for Eclipse 

*Minifinder for Eclipse* is a tool made by Vaadin to help Vaadin 8 developers understand in advance how well their applications can be transformed into the latest Vaadin version by Vaadin's semi-automated modernization service called, https://vaadin.com/vaadin-8-upgrade-automation-service[V8 Upgrade Automation]. 

It works by parsing the Java code in your project, resolving as many of your applicationâ€™s references to Vaadin libraries as it can, and outputting the high-level results in the Eclipse IDE console.

You can copy the report and share it with your colleagues or other Vaadin experts to discuss the benefits, and make an informed decision on whether to move on with V8 Upgrade Automation.


== Limitations

To make Minifinder as easy as possible to be use by organizations with strict security policies on installing tools in their network, the application is limited as follows:

- Minifinder runs locally and doesn't connect to the internet;
- It doesn't change your code; and
- It writes all output to a console instead of the disk.


== Using Minifinder for Eclipse

To use Minifinder with Eclipse, there are a few things to do: first, make sure Eclipse is ready to use the plugin; next, check that your application projects are ready to be analyzed; then run the analyzer; and interpret the results.


== Ensure Eclipse is Ready

Minifinder is distributed as a single-file Eclipse plugin JAR that you can copy into the Eclipse `/plugins` or `/dropins` folder from which you open your Vaadin 8 project. You may need to restart Eclipse after copying the file. You'll then see a button with a Vaadin logo (i.e., `]>`) appear in the toolbar.

.Latest Version
[NOTE]
Always make sure that you have the most up-to-date version of Minifinder. It contains the latest set of transformation rules that are available with the V8 Upgrade Automation.


== Check Application Projects are Ready

Minifinder depends on the Eclipse environment to resolve all names in your code with their corresponding types and packages in which they're declared. Eclipse is robust and can resolve names in sources that contain errors -- Minifinder may work even if your project has hundreds of Maven or Java errors. However, the fewer errors you have the better. It's therefore recommended that you check that your project is free of _red lines_ before launching Minifinder.

Close any project in your workspace of which doesn't contain any Vaadin 8 references. This prevents Minifinder from analyzing irrelevant code and saves times when analyzing.


== Run the Analyzer

Click the button (i.e., the Vaadin logo) in the toolbar that appeared after you installed the plugin. The tool is start with default settings that work with over 97% of all Vaadin 8 applications. Press [guilabel]*OK* to proceed with the analysis.

A progress bar should appear to show its progress.


== Interpret Results

After the progress bar reaches 100% and disappears, the analysis is finished. You can view the output. Minifinder for Eclipse writes output in the Eclipse Console.

The report is text-only and summarizes statistics on the references in the project code to Vaadin 8. Emphasis is on _method invocations_ and _constructor invocations_. Method invocations are invocations that appear in the project code within methods that are declared in Vaadin 8 classes. Constructor invocations are new keywords that are matched with constructors that are declared in Vaadin 8 classes.

Both of these invocations are included in the statistics if the method or constructor invoked is declared in a Vaadin class. This means that invocations on custom subclasses of Vaadin components in your project are included in the statistics if the method is inherited from its Vaadin super class. Furthermore, invocations on custom subclasses in your project won't be included in the statistics if the methods invoked are declared in your own custom subclass. 

The statistics for method and constructor invocations include an indication of coverage. A higher coverage rate is preferred. Coverage refers to a situation that is known and is dealt with high confidence that no further developer work is required. 

Basically, the transformation has been established for this declaration and the transformation tool contains a rule that handles it and the transformation requires no change. Or the transformation requires a change and that change is made by the tool with no manual intervention required.

Coverage assumes that the modernized application uses link:/docs/latest/advanced/classic-components[Classic Components] and a handful of utility methods that help bridge the gap in behavior between Vaadin 8 and later versions.
