= Component Variants

[.lead]
Many Vaadin components have so-called theme variants that provide different styles for the component.
These are defined as part of the built-in Lumo and Material themes, and documented for each component.

For example, Button has a "primary" variant, which can be used as follows:

[.example]
--

[source,java]
----
Button btn = new Button("Primary variant");
btn.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY);
----

--

Multiple theme variants can be simultaneously applied to a component, although not all variants are designed to be used together.

[.example]
--

[source,java]
----
Button btn = new Button("Primary + Small");
btn.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY, ButtonVariant.LUMO_SMALL);
----

--

== Variant Inheritance

Theme variants differ from CSS class names mainly in that they are automatically applied to sub-components within the shadow DOM of the component to which they are applied.
For example, <<../components/combo-box#, Combo Box>> contains a <<../components/text-field#, Text Field>> in its shadow DOM, so theme variants applied to a Combo Box are automatically passed down to the Text Field inside.
This means that you can apply Text Field variants to a Combo Box even though Combo Box doesn't have any variants of its own.

[.example]
--

[source,java]
----
ComboBox cb = new ComboBox("Small Combo Box");

// Components without their own theme variant API have to
// use a different syntax for applying them:
cb.getThemeList().add(TextFieldVariant.LUMO_SMALL.getVariantName());
----

--

Variant inheritance only works for sub-components in the shadow DOM, not with regular “light DOM” children of a component.
For example, Accordion Panel components inside an Accordion need to have their variants <<{articles}/ds/components/accordion/#theme-variants, applied to each panel>>.

== Custom Variants

You can define your own component theme variants using component-specific style sheets in a <<custom-theme#, custom theme>>.

.[filename]`vaadin-button.css`
[source,css]
----
:host([theme~="rounded"]) {
  border-radius: 1em;
}
----

You can then apply the theme variant similarly to the built-in variants:

[.example]
--

[source,java]
----
Button btn = new Button("Rounded");
btn.getThemeList().add("rounded");
----

--

These are inherited to sub-components similarly to the built-in variants.

See <<styling-components#, Styling Components>> to learn how to target the internal parts of Vaadin components.
