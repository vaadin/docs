.Features shared with Grid
[NOTE]
====
Tree Grid is an extension of the Grid component and all of Grid's features are available in Tree Grid as well.
====


== Tree Column

The tree column is a column that contains the toggles for expanding and collapsing nodes. Nodes are opened and closed by clicking a tree column's cell. They can also be toggled programmatically.

== Scroll to Index

You can scroll to a specific item by calling the [methodname]`scrollToIndex(index)` method and passing the item's index.
The index of an item depends on the item's position in the grid.
Since hierarchical data is lazy loaded, the grid doesn't know how many children each node has unless they're expanded.
Children items will take the indexes between their surrounding nodes *only if their parent node is expanded*.

.The Index of a Node Can Change
CAUTION: The effective index of a node will change when nodes before it are expanded or collapsed.

=== Scrolling Right After Expanding

When calling [methodname]`scrollToIndex(index)` right after expanding some nodes (during a single action, like a button click), the scrolling might execute _before_ the children nodes are rendered.
This means that it might perform the scrolling to a different target than the one you intended, as the indexes will change when the children nodes are rendered.
To work around this timing issue, you can expand the items in one action and perform the scrolling in a separate action (one button for each).

== Rich Content

Like Grid, Tree Grid supports rich content.

== Best Practises

Tree Grid is not meant to be used as a navigation menu.
