.Features shared with Grid
[NOTE]
====
Tree Grid is an extension of the Grid component and all of Grid's features are available in Tree Grid as well.
====


== Tree Column

The tree column is a column that contains the toggles for expanding and collapsing nodes. Nodes are opened and closed by clicking a tree column's cell. They can also be toggled programmatically.

== Scroll to Index

You can scroll to a specific item by calling the [methodname]`scrollToIndex(index)` method and passing the item's index.
However, the effective index of an item changes depending on which nodes are expanded or collapsed and other factors.
What portion of the grid is visible also affects how an item's effective index is calculated.

.Index of Items Can Vary
CAUTION: Items in a TreeGrid are not guaranteed to hold a specific index exclusively.

In contrast to Grid, the `scrollToIndex(index)` method in TreeGrid was designed to work in a pre-order traversal method.
Yet, TreeGrid doesn't know about all children (or the children of those children) a node has.
In addition, nodes are loaded in a lazy fashion for performance reasons, increasing the lack of knowledge of the complete structure of the tree.
The behaviour of *this method in TreeGrid* is not deterministic and *should be avoided*.

Scrolling right after expanding or collapsing nodes in a single action (for example, a button click) results in a scroll action before children of expanded nodes are rendered and children of collapsed nodes removed.
Since the effective index of some items changes after the expand or collapse, the grid might have ended up scrolling to a different item than intended.

== Rich Content

Like Grid, Tree Grid supports rich content.

== Best Practises

Tree Grid is not meant to be used as a navigation menu.
