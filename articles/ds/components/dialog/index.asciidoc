== Structure
The Dialog component has static header and footer areas, and a scrolling content area in between.
The header and footer are optional, and automatically hidden if empty and not explicitly enabled.

[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V23.1"]
=== Header
The header contains an optional title element, and a slot next to it for custom header content, such as a close button.

=== Footer
Buttons for closure actions, such as _Save_, _Cancel_, _Delete_, and so on, should be placed in the footer. 
See <<../button#buttons-in-dialogs,Button>> component for guidelines for the placement of buttons in dialogs. Footer content is right-aligned by default.
Components can be left-aligned by applying a margin:

=== Padding

The content area's built-in padding can be removed by applying the `no-padding` theme variant.

== Modality
A modal dialog blocks the user from interacting with the rest of the user interface while the dialog is open, as opposed to a non-modal dialog, which does not block interaction.

Dialogs are modal by default.

Use modal dialogs for:

* Displaying important information, like system errors
* Requesting user input as part of a workflow, for example, an edit dialog
* Confirmation of irreversible actions, such as deleting data (Confirm Dialog is a convenient alternative for these use cases)
* Breaking out sub-tasks into a separate user interface

Use non-modal dialogs:

* When the user needs access to the content below the dialog
* For less critical, optional, and/or support tasks

<vaadin-dialog modeless>...</vaadin-dialog>
----

[source,java]
----
<source-info group="Java"></source-info>
Dialog dialog = new Dialog();
dialog.setModal(false);
----

Non-modal dialogs should in most cases be draggable, so that the user can move them to access the user interface beneath.

== Draggable

Dialogs can be made draggable, enabling the user to move them around using a pointing device.


By default, the outer edges of a dialog, as well as the space between its components, can be used to move the dialog around.

The default areas from which a dialog can be dragged depend on whether the built-in header is used:

- If the built-in header or footer is used, they function as the dialog's default drag handles
- Without the built-in header, any empty space within the dialog functions as a drag handle

Any component contained within a dialog can be marked and used as a drag handle by applying the `draggable` class name to it.
You can choose whether or not to make the component's content draggable as well, or just the component itself.

It is recommended to make non-modal dialogs draggable so that the user can interact with content that might otherwise be obscured by the Dialog.
For example, a Dialog for taking notes, or adding widgets to a dashboard using drag and drop, can offer a better experience by allowing the user to move the Dialog around.

Modal dialogs do not benefit from being draggable, as their modality curtain (the dark overlay behind the dialog) obscures the underlying user interface.

== Resizable

A resizable dialog allows the user to resize the Dialog by dragging from the edges of the Dialog with a pointing device.
Dialogs are not resizable by default.

Dialogs containing dynamic content and/or a lot of information, such as complex forms or Grids, can benefit from being resizable as it offers the user some flexibility as to how much data is visible at once.
It also gives the user control over which part of the underlying user interface is obscured.

Dialogs that contain very little or compact information do not need to be resizable.

== Closing

Modal dialogs are closable in three ways:

. Pressing the kbd:[Esc] key
. Clicking outside the Dialog
. Programmatically, for example through the click of a Button

Providing an explicit button for closing a Dialog is recommended.

== Best Practices

=== Use Sparingly

Dialogs are disruptive by nature and should be used sparingly.
Do not use them to communicate nonessential information, such as success messages like “Logged in”, “Copied”, and so on.
Instead, use <<../notification#,Notifications>> when appropriate.

=== Button Placement

See <<../button#buttons-in-dialogs, Buttons in Dialogs>>.
