== Styles

The following variants can be used to distinguish between actions of different importance in the UI:

[.example]
--

[source,html]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/button/button-styles.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=TypeScript]
----

--

[%header, cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Variant
|Usage recommendations

|Primary
|* The most important action in a view or part of a view.
* The main closure or continuation action (such as Save) in a form or dialog.
* Avoid presenting the user with more than one at any time.

|Secondary
|* Default style recommended for most actions.
* Alternate or negative closure actions (e.g. Cancel) in a form or dialog.

|Tertiary
|* Lower importance actions
* Especially in parts of the UI with less space, such as cards, or for repeated actions for items in lists, tables, etc.
* Caution: Can easily be mistaken for non-interactive text
|===

=== Danger / Error Variants

A special style for distinguishing actions related to dangers, warnings or errors.

[.example]
--

[source,html]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/button/button-error.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=TypeScript]
----

--

Use this style for:

* Dangerous actions, such as those that will lose or destroy data.
* Primary danger buttons should only be used when the dangerous action is the most likely action, such as the affirmative Delete action in a deletion confirmation dialog.
* Secondary and Tertiary variants can also be used for actions related to current errors (such as resolving them or viewing their details).

=== Size Variants

The following size variants are available for Button instances whose size needs to be different from the default:

[.example]
--

[source,html]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/button/button-sizes.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=TypeScript]
----

--

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Variant |Usage recommendations

|Large
|For especially important call-to-action buttons, where extra emphasis is needed.

|Normal
|Default size.

|Small
|Compact option for cramped parts of the UI, if a Tertiary variant is not deemed appropriate.
|===

.Default button size can be customized
[TIP]
Size variants should only be used in special cases. See <<../../foundation/size-space#size-and-space,Size and Space>> for details on how to change the default button size.
