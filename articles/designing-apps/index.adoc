= Designing Applications the Vaadin Way

*The primary focus when designing an application should be the user*. Understanding their needs, goals, and challenges is key to creating a meaningful user experience. An application is only as good as its ability to solve problems efficiently and intuitively.

*Successful application design balances functionality with user empathy*, paying attention to visual hierarchy, responsiveness, simplicity, and user feedback — even when actual user input is limited.

== Avoid ‘Developer UX’

Avoid what's often referred to as ‘Developer UX’. This is a method in which the application becomes a reflection of a database or a feature dump. This approach typically leads to a cluttered, overwhelming experience -- particularly for non-technical users. It makes the application unnecessarily difficult to use.

Many common challenges can be addressed by applying established UI/UX best practices. This includes focusing on clarity, simplicity, and ease of navigation.

== User-Centered Design

Ideally, you should engage directly with users to grasp fully what they're trying to accomplish. You can do this through interviews, surveys, or usability tests. These offer valuable insights into users' motivations and pain points. However, you don't always have direct access to users. Therefore, you need to imagine the user experience while using the application.

A user-centered design approach should involve constant reflection on what users need at each stage. By prioritizing key features, using layouts that are easy to follow, and adhering to design principles like accessibility, performance, and consistency, you can create a streamlined, practical UI.

== Theming Options

.The examples throughout the "Designing Apps" pages are based on the Lumo theme.
[.small]
[NOTE]
The same design principles apply to both the Aura theme and any custom theme.

**Lumo theme** provides a wide range of CSS style properties. This allows easy global configuration of styles as well as detailed control over the visual appearance of individual components.

**Aura theme**'s visual style uses transparencies and smooth gradients. Its styling approach relies more on CSS calculations. Broad visual changes across the application can be done easily by adjusting only a few core style properties.

If you choose not to use a built-in theme, components provide minimal **base styles**. This option is intended to be a foundation for building a completely custom theme.
