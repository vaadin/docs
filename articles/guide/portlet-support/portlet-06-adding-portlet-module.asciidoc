= Adding a Vaadin Portlet Module to an Existing Maven Multi-Module Project

This document describes how to add a new Vaadin Portlet module to a Maven multi-module project.
The scenarios covered are 1) adding the Vaadin Portlet module to a Vaadin multi-module portlet project, where each portlet is packaged as a separate .war file with a shared static asset war, and 2) adding the Vaadin portlet module to a non-Vaadin multi-module project, where the portlet module builds two wars (one for the portlet and one for the static assets).

== 1. Adding a New Vaadin Portlet Module to an Existing Vaadin Multi-Module Portlet Project

=== Prerequisites

This short guide is applicable when:

- You have an existing Vaadin Portlet multi-module project containing a bundle module and one or more Vaadin Portlet modules, as described in <<portlet-05-creating-multi-module-portlet-project#,Creating Multi-Module Portlet Project>>; and
- You have a Vaadin Portlet module (either built from scratch or based on `base-starter-flow-portlet`); and
- Your objective is to integrate the new Vaadin Portlet module into the target project, so that you can build and deploy all Vaadin Portlet modules as separate wars together with a shared static asset war.

[[adding-submodule]]
=== Make Your Vaadin Portlet Module a Submodule of the Target Project

This step is identical to adding any Maven project as a submodule of an existing multi-module project.
First, copy your Vaadin Portlet module (here `myproject-newportlet`) inside the parent module of the multi-module project (here `myproject`). I.e, in this imaginary scenario it will end up in `myproject/myproject-newportlet`.
Then register `myproject-newportlet` as a submodule in `myproject/pom.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
<modules>
    <module>myproject-oldportlet</module>s
    <!-- any other existing portlet modules... -->
    <module>myproject-newportlet</module>

    <module>myproject-bundle</module>
</modules>
----
[NOTE]
The portlet modules should be added before the static asset module (here `myproject-bundle`).
The internal order of the portlet modules does not matter (unless there are project-specific interdependencies).

Also update the parent property in the portlet module's `pom.xml` to refer to the target project:
[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>com.myorg</groupId>
    <artifactId>myproject</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</parent>
----

Replace names and versions as applicable to your project.

=== Add the New Portlet as a Dependency of the Static Asset Module

In the `pom.xml` of your bundle module (here `myproject/myproject-bundle/pom.xml`), add the new Portlet Module artifact under `<dependencies>` with classifier `classes`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.myorg</groupId>
    <artifactId>myproject-newportlet</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <classifier>classes</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Replace `<groupId>`, `<artifactId>` and `<version>` contents as desired.

=== Remove Unnecessary Configuration From Portlet Module (If Applicable)

If your new Vaadin Portlet module was based on `base-starter-flow-portlet`, it will contain plugins and executions which are no longer needed when the module is part of a Vaadin multi-module portlet project.

First remove the entire `vaadin-maven-plugin` section from `pom.xml` (`artifactId` may alternatively be `flow-maven-plugin` depending on your configuration):

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <!-- ... -->
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

Next, under the `maven-war-plugin` of `pom.xml`, remove the entire execution with id `static-files`:

[source,xml]
----
<execution>
    <id>static-files</id>
    <goals>
        <goal>war</goal>
    </goals>
    <configuration>
        <warName>vaadin-portlet-static</warName>
        <!-- ... -->
    </configuration>
</execution>
----

Since the target project builds its own static asset module, these are no longer needed in the portlet module.
Next, we need to check that the portlet module is configured properly for inclusion in a multi-module project.

[[module-configuration]]
=== Configure the Added Portlet Module for the Multi-Module Project

In the `pom.xml` of the added portlet module, enable `<attachClasses>`:
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <attachClasses>true</attachClasses>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

Additionally, we must set the location from which the resources served by the common bundle war.
In the new portlet module, ensure that the file `src/main/resources/META-INF/VAADIN/config/flow-build-info.json` exists and has the following contents:
[source,js]
----
{
  "externalStatsUrl": "/myproject-bundle/VAADIN/config/stats.json"
}
----

The first component of the path (here `myproject-bundle`) must match the war name of the deployed static asset war.
[NOTE]
As this is a relative url it will target 127.0.0.1:8080.
This should use the correct known url of the bundle. For instance localhost on port 80 would be
 `http://127.0.0.1/myproject-bundle/VAADIN/config/stats.json`

For more information on setting up the multi-module project and packaging of static assets, see <<portlet-05-creating-multi-module-portlet-project#,Creating Multi-Module Portlet Project>>.


=== Package and Deploy the war Files

Run the following Maven command in the parent project:

`mvn package`

After the Maven build, a war file is created in the target folder of each portlet module as well as in the bundle module: `myproject-bundle/target/myproject-bundle.war`, `myproject-oldportlet/target/myproject-oldportlet.war`, ..., `myproject-newportlet/target/myproject-newportlet.war`.
To deploy, copy these files to the deployment directory of your web server or portal (`webapps` directory in Tomcat/Pluto).



== 2. Adding a New Vaadin Portlet Module to Non-Vaadin Multi-Module Project

=== Prerequisites

This short guide is applicable when:

- You have an existing Maven multi-module project that is not a Vaadin Portlet multi-module project; and
- You have a Vaadin Portlet module (either created from scratch or based on the `base-starter-flow-portlet`); and
- Your objective is to integrate the Vaadin Portlet module into the target project, so that you can build a portlet war and a static asset war for the Vaadin Portlet module.

=== Add the New Portlet Module to the Parent pom.xml

To add the Vaadin Portlet as a submodule in the existing multi-module project, follow the instructions under <<adding-submodule>> in the previous section.

=== Ensure that the New Portlet Module Builds Bundle and Portlet war Files

Ensure that the Vaadin Portlet `pom.xml` contains the `vaadin-maven-plugin` and two executions in the `maven-war-plugin` for building both the static asset bundle war and the portlet war.
If your portlet module is based on `base-starter-flow-portlet`, `vaadin-maven-plugin` is added and the executions already exist with the ids `static-files` and `portlet-war`, respectively.
Note that the `<warName>` of the static asset bundle must be exactly `vaadin-portlet-static` for the project to work out of the box.
To use a custom bundle name, you must add a `flow-build-info.json` file containing the static asset URL as explained in <<module-configuration>>.

=== Package and Deploy the war Files

Run the following Maven command in the parent project:

`mvn package`

After the Maven build, two war files are created: `myproject-bundle/target/vaadin-portlet-static.war` and  `myproject-newportlet/target/myproject-newportlet.war`.
To deploy, copy both files to the deployment directory of your web server or portal (`webapps` directory in Tomcat/Pluto).
