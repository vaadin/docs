= Vaadin Portlet Support

Vaadin Portlet Support for Vaadin 14.x+ is built on top of the <<Portlet 3.0
specification>> and requires Flow 2.2 and `vaadin-portlet` 1.0.0. Both are currently in alpha-stage
and expected to change.

[NOTE]
Some Vaadin features are not available in portlets, that includes e.g. `@PWA` annotation and all PWAs features.
