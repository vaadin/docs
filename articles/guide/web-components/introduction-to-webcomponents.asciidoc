= What are Web Components?

* Web Components are a collection of web standards allowing you to create new HTML tags with custom name, reusability and full encapsulation on styles & markup.
The standards are promised to be ubiquitous in modern browsers.

* The term "Web Components" might seem unfamiliar at first but in fact, you are already using web components**(*)** when you develop.
HTML elements like input, select, or textarea are all browser native web components. In short, native elements have followed the concept of the web components for a long time now.

_**(*)** Not to be confused with the uppercase initials - Web Components_

== Specifications

Web Components consist of four main standards [1] which can be used independently or all together:

*  **Custom Elements**: A set of APIs to define new HTML elements and their functionalities.
*  **Shadow DOM**: A set of APIs to provide encapsulation of the element's styles markup and functions so that your web component may remain "hidden"* and separated from the rest of the DOM.
*  **HTML Template**: The <template> element allows you to input fragments of HTML, which remain inert at page load, but can be instantiated at runtime.
*  **HTML Imports** **: A mechanism allows you to import and reuse a piece or the whole custom component from an external source.

_*everything in the shadow DOM can still be viewed and accessed._

_**HTML Imports is not standardized. It was a specification at the phase of the draft but received a heavy backlash from some modern browser vendors [2][3] and WebKit engineers [4]._


== Vaadin and Web components
Vaadin both makes and maintains a set of Web Components as well as uses them to provide Java web developers API
through https://vaadin.com/flow[Vaadin Flow].
