= Breaking API changes in Vaadin {vaadin-version}

A set of API breaking changes and their replacements are listed below:

- Property synchronization methods in `Element` are replaced with similar API in `DomListenerRegistration`: `getSynchronizedPropertyEvents`, `getSynchronizedProperties`, `removeSynchronizedPropertyEvent`, `removeSynchronizedProperty`, `addSynchronizedPropertyEvent`, `addSynchronizedProperty`,  `synchronizeProperty`.
- JavaScript execution APIs `executeJavaScript` and `callFunction` in `Element` and `Page` are replaced with similarly named methods that give access to the return value `executeJs` and `callJsFunction`:
- Miscellaneous `Element` methods: `Element(String, boolean)`, `addEventListener(String, DomEventListener, String...)`
- Device and platform detection methods `WebBrowser#isIOS()`, `WebBrowser#isIPad()`, `BrowserDetails#isSafariOrIOS()`, `BrowserDetails#isIOS()`, `BrowserDetails#isIPad()` are replaced with method in `ExtendedClientDetails`: `isIPad()`, `isIOS()`
- Methods `JsModule#loadMode()` and `Page#addJsModule(String, LoadMode)` for setting the load mode of JsModule are removed since it does not function with JavaScript modules.
- The construction methods `BeforeEvent(NavigationEvent, Class<?>)` and `BeforeEvent(Router, NavigationTrigger, Location, Class<?>, UI)` in `BeforeEvent` are replaced with `BeforeEvent(NavigationEvent, Class, List)` and `BeforeEvent(Router, NavigationTrigger, Location, Class, UI, List)`
-  Methods `getUrl()`, `getUrlBase()` and `getRoutes()` in `Router` are replaced with methods `getUrl()`, `getUrlBase()` and `getAvailableRoutes()` in `RouterConfiguration`. The `resolve()` method in `Router` is replaced with the `resolve()` method in `RouteUtil`. The `getRoutesByParent()` method in `Router` is removed and has no replacement.
- `ServletHelper` is replaced with `HandlerHelper`
- `ExecutionCanceler` is replaced with `PendingJavaScriptResult `
- The `getBodyAttributes` method in `AbstractTheme`, `Lumo` and `Material` is replaced with `getHtmlAttributes`
- The `removeDataGenerator` method in `HasDataGenerators` and `CompositeDataGenerator` is removed in favor of using the registration returned from `addDataGenerator(DataGenerator)`
- The mehtods `preventsDefault` and `stopsPropagation` in `ShortcutRegistration` are replaced with `isBrowserDefaultAllowed ` and `isEventPropagationAllowed`
-  The `safeEscapeForHtml` method in `VaadinServlet` is removed in favor of using `org.jsoup.nodes.Entities#escape(String)`
- The static method `getInstance` in `ApplicationRouteRegistry` is removed in favor of the instance method.
- The protected instance method `getApplicationUrl` from `VaadinServlet` is removed

== Bootstrapping changes from Vaadin 10-14 [[bootstrapping-changes-from-vaadin-10-14]]
For applications upgraded from earlier versions of Vaadin, client-side bootstrapping requires replacing the usages of the V10-14 `BootstrapHandler` APIs with their `IndexHtmlRequestHandler` API counterparts as described in <<../advanced/tutorial-modifying-the-bootstrap-page#IndexHtmlRequestListener-interface, _IndexHtmlRequestListener interface_>> section.

The reason for this API change is that with client-side bootstrapping the initial page HTML generation is separated from loading the Flow client and creating a server-side `UI` instance.

- In Vaadin 10 to 14 these two steps are combined and the `index.html` page includes the code and configuration needed to start the Flow client engine and link the browser page to the server-side `UI` instance.

- In Vaadin 15+ with client-side bootstrapping the `index.html` page includes only the basic HTML markup and links to the TypeScript UI code. When <<../typescript/creating-routes#,adding routes in TypeScript>>, the `UI` is not guaranteed to be created, thus is optional. It will be only available after the user navigates to a server-side route.
