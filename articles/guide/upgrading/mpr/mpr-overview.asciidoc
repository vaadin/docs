= Vaadin Multiplatform Runtime

The Vaadin Multiplatform Runtime (or MPR for short) allows the developer to run applications and components written
with a Legacy Framework (Vaadin 7 or Vaadin 8) inside a Vaadin 14 (Flow) application.

The Multiplatform Runtime is available to all Vaadin customers in the https://vaadin.com/pricing[Prime subscription] tier.
The project is licensed under the Commercial Vaadin Add-On License version 3 (CVAL).

Issues can be reported on the http://github.com/vaadin/multiplatform-runtime[MPR issues public repository].
