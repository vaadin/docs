= Step 3 - Running a Vaadin Legacy CDI application with MPR and Flow

[NOTE]
This step is needed in case your Vaadin 7 or 8 application uses CDI. If it is not the case, go back to the <<step-3-legacy-uis,framework selection>>.

== Updating to the correct CDI version

Remove any version from `com.vaadin:vaadin-cdi` as the proper Vaadin 14 compatible version for it is managed by the `vaadin-bom`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-cdi</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Handling of CDIUI annotation

Instead of `@CDIUI` use `@Route`.

[source,java]
----
@CDIUI
@Theme("valo")
public class TodoUI extends UI {
    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest vaadinRequest) {
        setContent(new HorizontalLayout());
    }
}
----

can for instance be replaced with

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class TodoUI extends Div implements HasLegacyComponents {
    @PostConstruct
    private void buildLayouts() {
        setSizeFull();
        add(new HorizontalLayout());
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
Annotations in the UI, such as `@Theme` and `@Title` and so on, will be dealt with later on in the tutorial.
Most of them have similar counterpart in either Flow or MPR.

== What to do with CDIView

Any `@CDIView` should be updated to a Flow Route by wrapping them as a `MprRouteAdapter<? extends View>`
or re-writing it to be a Flow Component. See <<step-3-navigator#no-navigator,Upgrading Views to Flow Routes>>


== What to do with ViewScopes

All ViewScopes should be changed to RouteScopes e.g.

* `@ViewScoped` to `@RouteScoped`
* `@NormalViewScoped` to `@NormalRouteScoped`

[NOTE]
In some projects CDI has ignored the archive and not instantiated objects as expected. This
is fixed by adding a `beans.xml` (empty is fine) file to `src/main/webapp/WEB_INF`.
