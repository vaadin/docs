= Step 3 - Converting legacy UIs

The UI object, which represents the `<body>` element in the page, is controlled by Flow when running the MPR,
so anything extending `UI` should be converted. Actually, `UI` class should not be
used for layouting or navigation handling anymore. At the end of step 3, you
should not have any `UI` class unless you have a real use case for it.

There are several conversion paths, depending on what's used in the project:

* My application uses <<step-3-spring-boot#,Spring Boot -> >>
* My application uses <<3-cdi#,CDI -> >>
* My application uses <<step-3-navigator#,Navigator -> >>
* My application doesn't use any of those. Continue to <<step-3-no-framework#,Converting a UI -> >>

Or:

* <<step-2-legacy-servlets#,<- Go back to step 2>>
* <<../Overview#,<- Go back to the overview>>
