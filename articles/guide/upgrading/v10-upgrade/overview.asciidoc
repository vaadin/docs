= Upgrade Guide from Vaadin 10-13 to Vaadin 14

.Revised for Vaadin 14.2
[NOTE]
This upgrade documentation has been revised for Vaadin 14.2 release (pnpm support).

For existing Vaadin platform projects (versions 10-13), using most Vaadin 14 new features
requires just updating the Vaadin version, adding a dependency for compatibility mode, and addressing any API changes in code, which can be backtracked
from the https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases[platform release notes].

Vaadin 14 also introduces support for new frontend technologies and tools,
which change the way the project is built and how frontend dependencies, like
web components, are integrated. This is the default starting point for new projects
starting from Vaadin 14, and an optional upgrade to take for existing projects.

First, this document introduces the new technologies and tooling.
Second, it gives an overview of the upgrade path from Platform V10-V13 to V14.
This is not intended to be a complete change log, but rather a hands-on guide to help resolving issues users
upgrading their applications to V14 will be expected to encounter.

*For Vaadin Java users, many of the changes described here only have effect on what happens on behind the scenes.
But in case you are using templates / Vaadin Designer or are integrating 3rd party frontend dependencies, you will want to read this document.*

*For component add-on developers, it is recommended to read this document, but
there are also <<v14-addon-guide#,add-on specific instructions
available>>.*

== New frontend tooling for Vaadin 14

Since Vaadin 10, the client-side UI components have been built as web components.
In versions 10 to 13, the web components and their dependencies have been distributed
using Bower, a package manager for frontend projects. For Vaadin Java projects, the Bower
dependencies have been packaged into `.jar` files using https://www.webjars.org/[Webjars],
allowing to use those directly with Maven.

Over time, Bower has been deprecated in favor of better frontend package managers.
While Bower still works and is maintained, it is lacking support for the latest web standards like https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules[JavaScript modules].

To be able to bring all the latest frontend technologies available to the
Vaadin users, the frontend technology stack and tooling
have been renewed in Vaadin 14.

[NOTE]
The old and the new toolset cannot be used at the same time!
This means eg. `@HtmlImports` are completely ignored when running the project
in _npm mode_, and vice versa `@JsModule` is ignored when running the project
in _Vaadin 13 compatibility mode_.

=== Web Components: ES6 modules instead of HTML Imports

_EcmaScript 6 modules_ (or JS modules) are a feature added to JavaScript as part of
the ECMAScript 2015 Language Specification. They provide a means for modulizing and
importing JavaScript code in the browser. Vaadin 14 adds support for JS modules
as a replacement for HTML imports which was used earlier for building web
components with the Polymer library. This means that the Polymer version has been
upgraded from version 2 to version 3 (see https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/about_30[here] what's
new in Polymer 3). In Polymer 3, templates are JavaScript modules that fully
encapsulate the HTML structure of the component template.

=== Package management: pnpm instead of Bower

Behind the scenes, Vaadin 14 manages front-end dependencies using _pnpm_ (AKA performant npm).
This is a fast and widely used JavaScript package manager (whereas V13 and older used _Bower_ & webjars).
Alternatively, also _npm_ can be used, but it has proven to be slower and less reliable than pnpm.
Using pnpm/npm means that all JavaScript dependencies will be downloaded to the `node_modules` directory
in the root of your project and that `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`/`package-lock.json` files will be
created to record and resolve the dependencies and their versions respectively.

Since Vaadin 14.2 pnpm tool is used by default for package management.
This is done transparently for the end user. In case there is a reason to use
npm instead of pnpm, you may disable pnpm (see <<../../../flow/advanced/tutorial-all-vaadin-properties#,All Vaadin properties>>
or <<../../production/tutorial-production-mode-advanced#,Advanced production mode topics>> sections).
Pnpm improves the package management in many ways, adding stability and
it allows to share the same packages between various projects to avoid downloading them again
for every project, and reducing a lot of IO operations. Just like Maven does, but npm
does not.

*Do not be alarmed if you are not familiar with these files or the npm way of doing things.
The installation and invocation of Node.js and pnpm/npm is fully automated by Vaadin.

=== Serving frontend resources with webpack

Another front-end tool utilized by Vaadin 14 behind the scenes is the module bundler _webpack_.
All dynamic frontend resources in your project (JavaScript modules containing
components and stylesheets) are now expected to reside in the `frontend`
directory immediately under the project root, which is inspected by webpack.
As application is started in development mode, the webpack development server is started automatically
to handle serving the frontend resources to the browser.

Unlike in Vaadin 10-13, using webpack enables testing your application with Internet Explorer 11
on development mode. Previously this required a production build to get the frontend resources
transpiled to IE11 compatible ES5 syntax. The overhead from this transpilation is about 1-2 seconds.

In production mode, webpack is used to create a (transpiled and minified) bundle from
the resources inside the `frontend` folder. As long as your project file structure
is as specified in this guide, these steps are fully automated by `vaadin-maven-plugin`.

While basic Vaadin usage requires no knowledge about webpack and how it works,
for advanced users there is also a possibility to customize the webpack build.

=== Compatibility mode

Existing Vaadin 10-13 projects can update to 14 without upgrading
to the new toolset. The only thing that you need to do is to upgrade your Vaadin
version to `14.0.15` (or the latest one) in your `pom.xml`. No more changes are needed in your
project. Behind the scenes, everything works just as before with using
Bower & Webjars, Polymer 2 & Html Imports, and Polymer CLI for the production build.
This is called _the compatibility mode_ in Vaadin 14.

The compatibility mode is only intended to enable a smoother upgrade path, and should not
be used in new projects. The compatibility mode is supported for the full Vaadin
14 support period, but it will be removed permanently in Vaadin 15.

Compatibility mode can be enabled explicitly by including the `flow-server-compatibility-mode`
jar. If using Maven, add the following dependency to `pom.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>flow-server-compatibility-mode</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, enable compatibility mode by setting the deployment configuration parameter
`vaadin.compatibilityMode` to `true`. Read more about setting configuration parameters
 <<../../../flow/advanced/tutorial-all-vaadin-properties#,here>>.

If using Spring Boot, setting the `vaadin.compatibilityMode` parameter is the mandatory solution
as the `web-fragment.xml` added by the `flow-server-compatibility-mode` dependency is not read.
To set the property, you may add the following line to `application.properties`:

[source, text]
----
vaadin.compatibilityMode=true
----

When using OSGI you need to add the following parameter to the WebServlet:
[source, text]
----
@WebInitParam(name = "compatibilityMode", value = "true")
----

Alternatively, add the property as a JVM parameter to the `spring-boot` plugin when running
the application via Maven:
`mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dvaadin.compatibilityMode=true"`

== Upgrade steps

To use the new toolset, any existing Vaadin projects with client-side Polymer 2
based web components must upgrade these from Polymer 2 syntax to Polymer 3 (see next section)
before they can run on V14. There is a upgrade tool available as a part of Maven plugin.
The goal `upgrade-to-p3` converts P2 templates to P3 templates and replaces `@HtmlImport`
annotations with `@JsModule` annotations, see <<tool#,Upgrade Tool>> tutorial.

For component add-on projects, there are <<v14-addon-guide#,
add-on specific upgrade instructions available>>.

=== 1 - Check prerequisites

[install.npm]
==== Node.js and npm

Since Version 14.2, Vaadin automatically downloads and installs Node.js and npm
into the `.vaadin` folder in the user's home directory. This step is skipped if
Node.js and npm are already installed globally. Older platform versions in the 14
series requires global installation. To install Node.js and npm gobally on your
system, download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/[https://nodejs.org/en/download/]
or use your preferred package management system (Homebrew, dpkg, ...).

==== Miscellaneous

* If you are using Java 9 or newer and `jetty-maven-plugin`, upgrade the
plugin to version `9.4.15.v20190215` or newer.

* If you are using Spring Boot, note that the minimum required version of
spring-boot-starter-parent is `2.1.0.RELEASE`.

=== 2 - Update project configuration

==== Update Platform version in `pom.xml`

The first step is to update your maven `pom.xml` configuration file to use the
latest V14 release. If the Vaadin version is specified in Maven properties,
change it to the following (use the latest Vaadin version):


[source, xml]
----
<properties>
    ...
    <vaadin.version>14.0.15</vaadin.version>
</properties>
----

[maven.plugin]
==== Add Vaadin Maven plugin

Next, add the Vaadin Maven plugin to the `<build><plugins>` section of `pom.xml`
(if your `pom.xml` already included this plugin, update the goals in the
`<execution><goals>` section):

[source, xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        ...
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
            <artifactId>vaadin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${vaadin.version}</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>prepare-frontend</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

The `prepare-frontend` goal checks that Node.js and npm are installed and
creates or updates `package.json` based on annotations in the project Java code.
It also creates `webpack.config.js` if it doesn’t exist yet (if needed, you can
add your own customized webpack configuration to this file, as it will not be
overwritten by future invocations of `prepare-frontend`).

[NOTE]
In V14, you need the `vaadin-maven-plugin` also in development mode.
So, make sure that you declare the plugin with `prepare-frontend` in your default Maven
profile.

For the production profile plugin you need to have the goal `build-frontend`:

[source, xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>production-mode</id>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            ...
            <plugin>
                <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
                <artifactId>vaadin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${vaadin.version}</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>build-frontend</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</profile>
----

The goal `build-frontend` invokes first pnpm to resolve and if necessary download & cache the frontend dependencies,
and then webpack to process the JavaScript modules. In case npm is used instead of
pnpm, the packages are always downloaded to the `/node_modules` directory in the project.
Pnpm only downloads packages once per system and shares them from a global cache.


[NOTE]
After pom.xml changes, remember to execute `mvn clean install`.

The goal `build-frontend` invokes pnpm/npm to download and cache the npm packages
(into directory node_modules) and webpack to process the JavaScript modules.

==== Move contents of src/main/webapp/frontend

In Vaadin 10-13, files related to front-end, such as HTML templates, stylesheets,
JavaScript files and images are stored in the folder
`<PROJDIR>/src/main/webapp/frontend`. Depending on the resource type, you may
need to move some of these resource files to a new `frontend` folder _at the
root of the project_, i.e., at `<PROJDIR>/frontend`. The following list is a
rough guide on what to do with each type of resource:

* HTML files containing Polymer templates, should be removed from the
`<PROJDIR>/src/main/webapp/frontend` once you finish the upgrade, but in the
meanwhile, you need them as reference to generate the equivalent JS modules
under the `<PROJDIR>/frontend` folder as described in the next section.
* Plain .css files used for global styling: keep them in
`<PROJDIR>/src/main/webapp/frontend`
* Custom JavaScript files: move them to `<PROJDIR>/frontend`
* Images and other static resources: keep them in
`<PROJDIR>/src/main/webapp/frontend` (or move anywhere else under `webapp`; see
comments about updating annotations in section 5)

[p2.p3.upgrade]
=== 3 - Convert Polymer 2 to Polymer 3

There is a upgrade tool available which does this conversation. See <<tool#,Upgrade Tool>> tutorial.

==== Templates

Polymer templates defined in HTML files (extension `.html` ) should be converted
to new ES6 module format files (extension `.js`) which in the basic case only
requires the following steps:
[loweralpha]
. Change the file extension from `.html` to `.js`.
. Change the parent class of the element class from `Polymer.Element` to
`PolymerElement`.
. Convert HTML imports for ES6 module imports. For example a local file

[source, xml]
----
<link rel=import href="foo.html">
----

becomes

[source, js]
----
import './foo.js';
----

or external import

[source, xml]
----
<link rel="import"
    href="../../../bower_components/vaadin-button/src/vaadin-button.html">
----

becomes

[source, js]
----
import '@vaadin/vaadin-button/src/vaadin-button.js';
----

To see what’s the scope of the js module, for vaadin components it’s always
@vaadin and for other components, you can search the name that comes after
`bower_components` https://www.npmjs.com/search[here] to find the scope.

[NOTE]
The upgrade tool converts all vaadin imports using correct scope automatically for you.
For other js modules you will need to do it manually.

[loweralpha, start=4]
. Move the template from HTML into a static getter named `template` inside
the element class which extends `PolymerElement`.

E.g.

[source, xml]
----
<template>
    <vaadin-text-field id="search">
    </vaadin-text-field>
    <vaadin-button id="new">New
    </vaadin-button>
</template>
----

becomes

[source, js]
----
static get template() {
    return html`
        <vaadin-text-field id="search">
        </vaadin-text-field>
        <vaadin-button id="new">New
        </vaadin-button>`;
}
----

[loweralpha, start=5]
. Remove the `<dom-module>` and `<script>` tags.

As a complete example, the following template

[source, xml]
----
<link rel="import" href="../../../bower_components/polymer/polymer-element.html">
<link rel="import" href="../../../bower_components/vaadin-text-field/src/vaadin-text-field.html">
<link rel="import" href="../../../bower_components/vaadin-button/src/vaadin-button.html">

<dom-module id="top-bar">
    <template>
        <div>
            <vaadin-text-field id="search">
            </vaadin-text-field>
            <vaadin-button id="new">New
            </vaadin-button>
        </div>
    </template>

    <script>
        class TopBarElement extends Polymer.Element {
            static get is() {
                return 'top-bar'
            }
        }

        customElements.define(TopBarElement.is, TopBarElement);
    </script>
</dom-module>
----


becomes

[source, js]
----
import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer/polymer-element.js';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-button/src/vaadin-button.js';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-text-field/src/vaadin-text-field.js';

class TopBarElement extends PolymerElement {
    static get template() {
        return html`
            <div>
                <vaadin-text-field id="search">
                </vaadin-text-field>
                <vaadin-button id="new">New
                </vaadin-button>
            </div>`;
    }

    static get is() {
        return 'top-bar'
    }
}

customElements.define(TopBarElement.is, TopBarElement);
----

==== Styles

Converting `<custom-style>` elements is straightforward. The containing HTML
file should be converted to a js file and the content of the file, imports
excluded, should be added to the head of the document in JavaScript code. Any
import should be converted from `<link>` tag to a javascript import statement
the same way as for templates. The following example illustrates these steps in
practice.

Polymer 2:

[source, xml]
----
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/polymer/lib/elements/custom-style.html">

<custom-style>
    <style>
        .menu-header {
            padding: 11px 16px;
        }

        .menu-bar {
            padding: 0;
        }
    </style>
</custom-style>
----

Polymer 3:

[source, js]
----
import '@polymer/polymer/lib/elements/custom-style.js';
const documentContainer = document.createElement('template');

documentContainer.innerHTML = `
    <custom-style>
        <style>
            .menu-header {
                padding: 11px 16px;
            }

            .menu-bar {
                padding: 0;
            }
        </style>
    </custom-style>`;

document.head.appendChild(documentContainer.content);
----

[NOTE]
The upgrade tool takes care about style files and `@StyleSheet` annotations
converting them into `@JsModule`. But there is `@CssImport` annotation available
which is more convenient to use instead of `@JsModule` for CSS. The upgrade tool
is not able to convert styles using `@CssImport` annotation. This requires manual
conversation.

==== Polymer modulizer

For more complex cases you can use
https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/upgrade[Polymer 3 upgrade guide].
You can also use polymer-modulizer tool that is described in the guide. The
upgrade tool available with the Vaadin Maven Plugin is internally using the
polymer-modulizer for upgrading the Polymer 2 templates to Polymer 3.

=== 4 - Update Java annotations

The upgrade tool is able to do this step for you automatically, see <<tool#,Upgrade Tool>> tutorial.

After converting Polymer templates from HTML to JavaScript modules, every
`HtmlImport` annotation in Java classes should be changed to a `JsModule`
annotation. Moreover, you should not use a frontend protocol (`frontend://`)in
the path of your resources anymore, and add the `./` prefix to the file path.
E.g.

[source, java]
----
@HtmlImport("frontend://my-templates/top-bar.html")
----

becomes

[source, java]
----
@JsModule("./my-templates/top-bar.js")
----


==== WebJars
If you are developing an application or an add-on which depends on web components from webjars, like below:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars.bowergithub.polymerelements</groupId>
    <artifactId>paper-slider</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
then the upgrade tool won't be able to rewrite correctly the `@HtmlImport` annotation
unless it is a Vaadin web component. In this case the `@HtmlImport` will be replaced by `@JsModule` but you
should correct the value by yourself since the upgrade tool is not able to detect the
scope of the JS module automatically. Here are the steps you need to do for each WebJar in your project:

* Find the npm package of the web component. You should be able to find it via
one of the following ways.
** Go to the GitHub repository page of the component and most likely the package
name is mentioned in the readme file. For the given example, the owner
name of the component on GitHub is the last part of the groupId which is `polymerelements`,
So, after adding the name of the component, the address of its GitHub repository
can be determined as https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-slider. Then the
npm package name can be found under installation section in front of `pnpm install` (or `npm install`)
command. So, the npm package is `@polymer/paper-slider`.

** Search on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com).
The name of the web component should be the same.
The scope of the package should match the groupId of the dependency.
It can be used to identify the correct npm package if name brings up duplicates.
For the given example, you can search for `paper-slider` and among the results,
you can see that one of them has the `@polymer` scope has the best match.
So, the corresponding npm package is `@polymer/paper-slider`.

* Add `@NpmPackage` annotation to your class. After finding the right npm
package and choosing the version that you want to use, you should add `@NpmPackage`
annotation with the package name (as `value` parameter) and package version
It means that you should add the following annotation
to your class. In this example
+
```
@NpmPackage(value = "@polymer/paper-slider", version = "3.0.1")
```
If you want to use the latest minor release of the npm package instead of a
fixed version, then you should add a caret before the version. E.g. the above
annotation would become like the following.
+
```
@NpmPackage(value = "@polymer/paper-slider", version = "^3.0.1")
```
+
For more information about the versioning of npm packages, see [this](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies).

* Update the value of `@JsModule` annotation with the correct path which can be
found on the same page where the npm package is found. For our example, it's
`@polymer/paper-slider/paper-slider.js`. So, the annotation would be:
+
```
@JsModule("@polymer/paper-slider/paper-slider.js")
```

=== 5 - Remove frontend protocol

Apart from `JsModule` annotations, the `frontend://` protocol should also be
removed from non-annotation resource accessors in Java code or in JavaScript
code. For example in V10-V13 to add a PNG file from
`<PROJDIR>/src/main/webapp/img` folder, you would do as follows:

[source, java]
----
String resolvedImage = VaadinServletService.getCurrent()
    .resolveResource("frontend://img/logo.png",
    VaadinSession.getCurrent().getBrowser());

Image image = new Image(resolvedImage, "");
----

In V14, the above becomes:

[source, java]
----
String resolvedImage = VaadinServletService.getCurrent()
    .resolveResource("img/logo.png",
    VaadinSession.getCurrent().getBrowser());

Image image = new Image(resolvedImage, "");
----

=== 6 - Build and maintain the V14 project

Test the new configuration by starting the application. How you do this depends
on your application deployment model. For example, if you are using the Jetty
maven plugin, run:

`mvn clean jetty:run`

You should see Maven log messages confirming that pnpm/npm is downloading the package
dependencies and that webpack is emitting `.js` bundles. If there is any error,
go back and re-check the previous steps.

The following files/folders have been generated in the root of your project:

* `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`/`package-lock.json`: These files keep track of frontend
packages and pin their versions. You may want to add these to version control,
in particular, if you added any local package directly with pnpm/npm commands.
* `node_modules` directory: pnpm/npm package cache, do not add this to version
control!
* `webpack.config.js`: webpack configuration. Include in version control. You
can add custom webpack configuration to this file.
* `webpack.generated.js`: Auto-generated webpack configuration imported by
`webpack.config.js`. Do not add to version control, as it is always overwritten
by `vaadin-maven-plugin` during execution of the `prepare-frontend` goal.

You now have a fully upgraded Vaadin 14 project. Enjoy!
