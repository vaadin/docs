= Importing a Project into Eclipse

[NOTE]
If you're importing a multi-module Maven project, make sure you select the correct project to import. You typically want to select all the projects.

Finally, click [guibutton]*Finish*. Eclipse imports the project and starts downloading the required resources.

After the import finishes, you are ready to explore the project. If you need to make changes to the configuration, see <<{articles}/configuration/properties#, Configuration>>.

To run the application, proceed to <<../running/eclipse#, Running an Application in the Eclipse IDE>>.
