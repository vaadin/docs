= Running a Project in NetBeans IDE

This page describes how to run a project with NetBeans integrated development environment.

== Running Maven Goals

NetBeans has integration with Maven, enabling you to run Maven commands. Besides building and cleaning the project, you can run the web application in an embedded web server.

Select the project in the *Projects* view. NetBeans shows common https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_build_goal[Maven goals] inside the *Navigator* view:

Double-click a goal to execute it.

=== Running the Web Application

You can run the web application in an embedded web server by running the appropriate goal for your technology stack.

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
| Technology Stack | Embedded Server | Goal to Run
| Spring Boot | – | `spring-boot:run`
| CDI / Java EE | Apache TomEE | `tomee:run`
| Plain Java | Jetty | `jetty:run`
|===

While the server is running, when you edit and save any source files, the server notices the change and redeploys the web application. You can also enable <<{articles}/configuration/live-reload#,live reload>>.

To stop the server, click the "stop" button in the *Output* view:

=== Binding Maven Goals to IDE Actions

As running the web application is a frequent task during development, you may want to bind such a Maven goal to an _IDE action_.

To associate the *Run project* action with a Maven goal to start the server, proceed as follows:

- Right-click the project in the *Projects* view and select *Properties*.
- In the *Project Properties* window, select *"Categories > Actions"*.
- Select the *"Actions > Run project"* option.
- Type the goal to start the web server in *Execute Goals*: `jetty:run` (plain Java project), `tomee:run` (CDI project), or `spring-boot:run` (Spring Boot project).
- Click [guibutton]*OK*:

You can now deploy and run the web application by clicking the "run" icon in the toolbar:

You can repeat the process to bind the same Maven goal to the *Debug project* IDE action, as well.

If the Vaadin application was created with the project wizard or a Maven archetype, you should be able to access it at http://localhost:8080/[localhost:8080].

With the above configuration, you can now use NetBeans to develop your Vaadin application with Maven.
