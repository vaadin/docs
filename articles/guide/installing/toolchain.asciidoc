= Working with a Toolchain

In this section, we go through how the development tools work together.
<<figure.toolchain>> illustrates a development toolchain.

You normally develop your Vaadin application as a Maven project using an IDE.
An optional IDE plugin can help in creating and managing the project.
The _npm_ package manager is used for retrieving the front-end code dependencies.
The _webpack_ utility is used for packaging the front-end code, together with any application front-end code.
The server-side code and package the project are compiled and packaged using Maven.
The project must include, in addition to your server-side code, the Vaadin libraries.
It can also include application-specific themes as well as front-end code.

You need to compile and deploy a project to a web container before you can use it.
Some IDEs support integration with web servers to manage the servers and handle deployment and debugging.
You can also deploy a project manually, by creating a web application archive (WAR) and deploying it to the web container.

== A Reference Toolchain

Vaadin supports a wide variety of tools, so you can use any IDE for writing the code, almost any Java web server for deploying the application, most web browsers for using it, and any operating system platform supported by Java.

In addition to the basic requirements listed earlier, a recommended toolchain would be:

* link:https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[Amazon Corretto 11]
* link:http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers]
* Vaadin Plugin for the Eclipse IDE
* link:http://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat 9.0 (Core)]
* link:https://www.google.com/chrome/[Google Chrome] browser

The above reference toolchain is a good choice of tools, but you can use almost
any tools you are comfortable with.

In Eclipse, you can deploy the application automatically to the web server through the Web Tools Platform (WTP) for Eclipse (included in the Eclipse EE package).
