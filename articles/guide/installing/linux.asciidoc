= Installing Tools in Linux

This section contains instructions for some Debian- and RPM-based distributions.
The installation should be very similar on other Linux distributions.

== Debian and Ubuntu

On Debian and Ubuntu, it is easiest to use OpenJDK, as it is available in the standard  package repositories.
Similarly, Maven, Git, and Node.js are available from a repository.
The Node.js package includes npm, the Node package manager used for handling frontend dependencies.

. Install Node.js package sources
+
Most distributions do not have a sufficiently new Node.js version through their package manager.
Begin by adding the latest Node.js LTS repository to your APT sources:
+
----
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
----

. Install the development tools
+
You can install all the needed development tools easily with:
+
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk maven git nodejs
----

If your system does not have `sudo` installed, execute the above commands as root.

== Fedora and RHEL

On Fedora (since 18) and RHEL (since 8), you use the DNF package manager.

. Install the development tools:
+
----
$ sudo dnf -y install java-11-openjdk.x86_64 maven nodejs
----

. Ensure that you are running Java 11 by running:
+
----
$ java -version
----
+
If you are not using 11, change it with:
+
----
$ sudo alternatives --config java
----
+
Select OpenJDK 11.

== RPM-based Systems Using YUM

. Install Node.js package sources
+
Most distributions do not have a sufficiently new Node.js version through their package manager.
Begin by adding the latest Node.js LTS repository to your APT sources:
+
----
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
----

. Install the development tools:
+
----
$ sudo yum install -y java-11-openjdk-devel.x86_64 maven git nodejs
----

. Ensure that you are running Java 11 by running:
+
----
$ java -version
----
+
If you are not using 11, change it with:
+
----
$ sudo alternatives --config java
----

== OpenSuSE

On OpenSuSE, you use the zypper package manager as follows:

----
$ sudo zypper install java-11-openjdk maven nodejs12
----

Depending on your system version, you may need to install package repositories or do some other steps.

== Arch Linux

On Arch Linux, you use the pacman package manager as follows:

----
$ pacman -S jdk11-openjdk maven nodejs
----

Depending on your system version, you may need to install package repositories or do some other steps.

== Installing Amazon Corretto

If you want to install Amazon Corretto rather than OpenJDK, you either have to add the package repository or install it from a DEB, RPM, or a tar package.

See:
