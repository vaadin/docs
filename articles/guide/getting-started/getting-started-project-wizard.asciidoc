= Creating a Project with a Project Wizard

The Vaadin website offers two ways to create a downloadable starter project:

* Using the quick starter wizard at http://vaadin.com/start[vaadin.com/start], as described in <<getting-started.project-wizard.quick, Using the Quick Starter Wizard>>

* Using the customization wizard at http://start.vaadin.com[start.vaadin.com], as described in <<getting-started.project-wizard.customizing, Creating a Customized Project>>.

== Using the Quick Starter Wizard

In the following, we describe how you can create a simple downloadable project with the quick starter wizard.
The project has a minimalistic UI with an input field and a button, and a service layer stub.

. Navigate to http://vaadin.com/start[vaadin.com/start].

. Choose the Vaadin version for the project.
The latest LTS (Long-Term Service) version is suggested, but you can also choose a newer sversion if one is available.

. Enter a *Maven Group ID*.
This is usually your corporation ID or a personal ID.
You are welcome to use one under `org.vaadin`, especially for open-source projects.

. Enter a *Project Name*.
It will also be used for the project ID in lowercase, with spaces replaced by dashes.

. Click *Download*.

. Unzip the downloaded archive to a file location of your choice.
+
TIP: Avoid unzipping to the download folder, as you could unintentionally delete your project when clearing out old downloads.

After downloading the package and uncompressing it, you are now ready to import the project in your IDE, as described in subsequent sections.
Please see the instructions for your IDE in <<getting-started-eclipse#getting-started.eclipse.importing, Importing a Project in the Eclipse IDE>>, <<getting-started-eclipse#getting-started.eclipse.importing, Importing a Project in IntelliJ>>, or <<getting-started-netbeans#getting-started.netbeans.importing, Importing a Project in NetBeans>>.

== Creating a Customized Starter Project

To create customized starter application, click [guibutton]#Customize App# in the project wizard, or navigate directly to the https://start.vaadin.com/[start.vaadin.com] to create a new project.
The customization wizard allows creating Vaadin 15 projects.
