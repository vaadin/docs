= Starting a Vaadin Project in NetBeans

In this article, we go through creating or importing a new Vaadin project in NetBeans, and running it.

With NetBeans, you can create a project:

* Externally, using an application wizard or a Maven archetype, and then importing it to NetBeans.
* Creating from a Maven archetype in NetBeans.

Maven is a project management tool that goes beyond dependency management.
See https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts[Learning Maven Concepts] for more.

== Importing the Project

. In NetBeans, select *"File > Open Project..."*.
. Select the folder containing the Maven project you want to import.

. Click *Open Project* to complete the process.

== Running Maven Goals

NetBeans has integration with Maven, enabling you to run Maven commands.
Besides building and cleaning the project, you can run the web application in an embedded web server.

. Select the project in the *Projects* view.

NetBeans will show common https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_build_goal[Maven goals] inside the *Navigator* view:

. Double-click a goal to execute it.

=== Running the Web Application

You can run the web application in an embedded web server by running the appropriate goal for your technology stack.

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
| Technology Stack | Embedded Server | Goal to Run
| Spring Boot | â€“ | `spring-boot:run`
| CDI / Java EE | Apache TomEE | `tomee:run`
| Plain Java | Jetty | `jetty:run`
|===

While the server is running, you can edit and save any source files, and the server notices the change and redeploys web application.
You can also enable _live reload_, as described in <<../workflow/overview#, Application Development Workflow>>.

To stop the server, click the stop button in the *Output* view:

[[getting-started.netbeans.maven.actions]]
=== Binding Maven goals to IDE actions

As running the web application is a frequent task during development, you may want to bind such Maven goal to an _IDE action_.

To associate the *Run project* action to a Maven goal to start the server, do as follows:

. Right-click the project in the *Projects* view and select *Properties*.
. In the *Project Properties* window, select *"Categories > Actions"*.
. Select the *"Actions > Run project"* option.
. Type the goal to start the web server in *Execute Goals*: either `jetty:run` (plain Java project), `tomee:run` (CDI project), or `spring-boot:run` (Spring Boot project).
. Click [guibutton]#OK#:

Now you can deploy and run the web application by clicking the run icon in the toolbar:

You can repeat the process to bind the same Maven goal to the *Debug project* IDE action as well.

If the Vaadin application was created with the project wizard or a Maven archetype, you should be able to access it at http://localhost:8080.

With the above configuration, you can now use NetBeans to develop your Vaadin application with Maven.
