= Themes and Styling

Learn how to use the <<built-in-themes#,built-in themes>> and their <<theme-variants#,variants>>, how to <<theming-basics#,customize them>> and how to <<styling-vaadin-components#,theme and style Vaadin components>>.

=== Prerequisites

Themes are built and customized using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
You should be comfortable writing CSS to be able to effectively customize themes and style components.

The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS tutorials on MDN] are a great way to learn the basics of CSS.
<<style-scopes#,Style scopes>> and <<css-custom-properties#,CSS custom properties and variables>> are especially important topics to understand.

== Concepts

=== Theme

A theme makes an app look and feel consistent to the end user.
It defines global font styles and text and background colors and defines the styles of all components.

A theme and can also affect the behavior of components.
For example, where the date picker overlay opens on small viewport sizes.

Technically, themes are a collection of style sheets which are loaded when the application starts.
Style sheets are authored either as traditional `.css` files or as `.js` files (ES modules) if you are including them in client-side code.

=== Theme Variants

Variants are opt-in features of each theme which affect the visual presentation of components.
Themes can define global and component-specific variants.
Theme variants can be used in all style scopes across an app.

Examples of global variants are color palettes (dark, high contrast, etc.) and sizing & spacing (compact vs loose).

Examples of component-specific variants are primary buttons and small sized input fields.

Technically, theme variants are applied in HTML using the `theme` attribute.

=== Theming

The term *“theming”* is used for styles that apply across the whole app to all component instances.
For example, you could theme all button components across an entire app to have a certain background color, or choose a certain font to be used for all components.

=== Styling

The term *“styling”* is used for styles that apply to particular instances of components.
For example, you could style an individual button in one view to have a different background color than all the other buttons in the app, or increase the cell padding of a data grid in one view.

The techniques used for theming and styling are mostly the same.
The main difference is how you scope the CSS: for all component instances, its theme variants, or only to specific instances.

=== Style Scope

CSS can be scoped to apply to only certain parts of the element hierarchy.
A style scope refers one such part of the hierarchy.
See <<style-scopes#,Style Scopes>> for more information.
