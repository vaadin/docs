= Formatting Vaadin Documentation With AsciiDoc
:experimental:

This document describes basic styling of Vaadin AsciiDoc documentation.

== Images

=== Image Basics

Images include screenshots and diagrams.
They should always have a caption and an ID, unless inside a step-by-step list.
The ID should follow the ID hierarchy of the containing section.
It should be prefixed with `figure.`.
Images can be referenced from text.

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
The result is shown in <<figure.images.example>>.

[[figure.images.example]]
.An example of an image
image::images/mymodule-example.png[width=70%, scaledwidth=100%]
----

It would render as:

[subs="normal"]
====
The result is shown in <<figure.images.example>>.

[[figure.images.example]]
.An example of an image
image::img/vaadin-logo.png[width=50%, scaledwidth=60%]
====

Images should be located under an [filename]#images# sub-folder.

=== Inline Images

You can display images also inline, without an image frame and caption.
This is recommended in task lists with screenshots, and in other cases where a caption is not needed and an image frame might be distracting.
To do so, have only one colon in `image:`.

For example:

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
. Click the button.
. The image should now look as follows:
image:images/example-image.png[width=30%]
----

It would render as:

[subs="normal"]
====
. Click the button.
. The image should now look as follows:
image:img/vaadin-logo.png[width=30%]
====


=== Captions

The caption may not be in title case.

References to images use the caption text in the reference.
However, it is used differently in Vaadin Docs and the print edition.

In Vaadin Docs, it is shown as is in the link.

[subs="normal"]
====
The result is shown in <<figure.images.example>>.
====

In print or PDF version, the reference includes "_Figure x.x <caption>_", with the chapter number and figure number in the chapter.

[example]
====
The result is shown in Figure 1.1, "An example of an image".

=== Requirements for Illustrations

Illustrations have the following requirements:

_Always use white background_::
Paper is white. +
When taking screenshots, use a white background when necessary.
Make sure the white background does not get transparent when taking screenshots.

_Do not use transparency in images_::
PNG and GIF images allow transparency.
While they may show fine in the website, in PDF the transparent parts are rendered as black.
This makes them very ugly.

_Use high resolution for screenshots_::
Otherwise, pixels will show up ugly when the images are scaled.
You can use the browser zoom feature to enlarge Vaadin UIs.
Scale the images as described in <<contributing.formatting.image.scaling>>.

_Minimize screenshot content_::
Space is precious especially in the print edition. +
Select only the relevant area for the screenshot.
Sometimes, adding some cut context may clarify the screenshot.
Some views or dialog windows can be overly complex or large.
You should consider simplifying them with an image editor.
You can use PhotoShop or Gimp or whatever.

_Fonts must not be too small_::
The text column in the print edition is 82 mm (3.23 inches) wide.
Height of the normal font is 2 mm or 6 points (1/72").
That means around 1/40 of the text column width.
Text in diagrams should not be much smaller than this.
If text is less than half of this, it is unreadable.
+
For example, if an image is 800 pixels wide and scaled as 100%, the normal font should be 20 pixels high.
Text would have to be at least 10 pixels high, and anything smaller would anyhow be blurry.

[[contributing.formatting.image.scaling]]
=== Image Scaling

Images are displayed in at least three formats: Vaadin Docs website, pocket-book sized print edition, and large size PDF.
There could also be an ePub format.
All images need to be scaled for all these resolutions.

AsciiDoc has two scaling parameters: `width` and `scaledwidth`.

 image::img/mymodule[width=70%, scaledwidth=100%]

`width` (optional)::
 This parameter is used for the HTML web edition in Vaadin Docs.
 The images are automatically limited to the maximum width of the text area.

`scaledwidth`::
This parameter is used for the print and PDF editions.
It is used as is for the pocket-size edition.
For the large PDF edition, it is multiplied by 0.8, as otherwise the images intended for the print edition would get too large.

////
In DocBook output, scaling for the different editions is handled in the docbook-cleanup.xml script. It generates "smallscale" attribute for the pocket edition and "largescale" for large PDF. These are processed by our DocBook customizations in custom-fo-docbook.xsl and custom-fo-docbook-pocket.xsl.
