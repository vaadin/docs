== Requirements for Merging

* Deployment preview build must finish successfully
* You must have signed the Contributor License Agreement

There are also some optional requirements, which are not enforced:

* Vale checks are successful

== Merging

For contributions, a pull request will be merged by a reviewer once it has been approved.

Vaadin developers with write access to the repository will be able to merge their own pull request once it is reviewed and all checks are successful.
This gives the possibility to get early comments for new documentation, while keeping on writing it.
