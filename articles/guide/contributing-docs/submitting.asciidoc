= Submitting Documentation

To submit additions or corrections to Vaadin documentation, you need to create a pull request in the Docs repository.

Merging a pull request has the following requirements:

* The pull request must have been accepted in review
* Deployment preview build must finish successfully
* You must have signed the Contributor License Agreement

See <<../contributing/overview#, Contributing to Projects>> for general instructions on contributing to Vaadin.
You should separate all enhancements, fixes, and new features into different pull requests.
Check your changes for basic style violations.

== Making a Pull Request

To do so, you need to create a feature branch and push that for review.

* Contributors should:
** Fork the https://github.com/vaadin/docs[`https://github.com/vaadin/docs`] repository
** Clone it locally to edit it

[source, bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/vaadin/docs.git
----

** Make a new branch for the improvements
+
[source, bash]
----
$ git checkout -b my-feature-branch
----

** Make the changes
** Push the changes to the repository
** Create a pull request in the Docs repository

== Requirements for Merging

=== Reviewing a Contribution

=== Accepting the CLA

== Merging

For contributions, a pull request will be merged by a reviewer once it has been approved.

Vaadin developers with write access to the repository will be able to merge their own pull request once it is reviewed and all checks are successful.
This gives the possibility to get early comments for new documentation, while keeping on writing it.
