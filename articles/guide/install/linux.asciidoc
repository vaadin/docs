= Installing Development Tools in Linux

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Abbr = NO -->]

[.lead]
To start developing with Vaadin, you need to install Java (JDK) and http://maven.apache.org[Maven].

The instructions are for Debian-based and RPM-based distributions.
They should be similar on other Linux distributions.

== Debian and Ubuntu

On Debian and Ubuntu, it is easiest to use OpenJDK, as it is available in the standard  package repositories.
Similarly, Maven is available from a repository.

. Install the development tools
+
You can install all the needed development tools with:
+
----
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk maven
----

If your system does not have `sudo` installed, run the above commands as root.

== Fedora and RHEL

On Fedora (since 18) and RHEL (since 8), you use the DNF package manager.

. Install the development tools:
+
----
sudo dnf -y install java-11-openjdk.x86_64 maven
----

. Ensure that you are running Java 11 by running:
+
----
java -version
----
+
If you are not using 11, change it with:
+
----
sudo alternatives --config java
----
+
Select OpenJDK 11.

== RPM-based Systems Using YUM

. Install the development tools:
+
----
sudo yum install -y java-11-openjdk-devel.x86_64 maven
----

. Ensure that you are running Java 11 by running:
+
----
java -version
----
+
If you are not using 11, change it with:
+
----
sudo alternatives --config java
----

== OpenSuSE

On OpenSuSE, you use the zypper package manager as follows:

----
sudo zypper install java-11-openjdk maven
----

Depending on your system version, you may need to install package repositories or do some other steps.

== Arch Linux

On Arch Linux, you use the pacman package manager as follows:

----
pacman -S jdk11-openjdk maven
----

Depending on your system version, you may need to install package repositories or do some other steps.

== Installing Amazon Corretto

If you want to install Amazon Corretto rather than OpenJDK, you either have to add the package repository or install it from a DEB, RPM, or a tar package.

See:

* Instructions for installing from APT (Debian) or YUM (RPM) repository in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/linux-info.html[Amazon Corretto 11 Guide for Linux]

* Download installation packages from link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html]
