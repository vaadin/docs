= Installing the Vaadin Plugin for the Eclipse IDE

:experimental:

The Vaadin Plugin for the Eclipse IDE includes wizards for creating new Vaadin-based projects.
During development, it triggers the compilation of frontend resources.
It also gives notifications about new Vaadin blog posts, and so forth.

You can also choose to install Vaadin Designer, a commercial visual design tool for professional developers.
It allows for easy creation of declarative designs.
It is also good as a sketching tool, as well as an easy way to learn about Vaadin components and layouts.

Once you have installed the Eclipse IDE and the plug-in, you can create a Vaadin application project as described in <<../start/eclipse#, "Creating a Project in Eclipse">>.

The plugin also allows creating and compiling Vaadin 8 and 7 projects.
For those features, please refer to Vaadin 8 documentation.

More installation instructions regarding the Eclipse plugin can be found at
https://vaadin.com/eclipse[vaadin.com/eclipse].

Enter a name such as "Vaadin Update Site" and the URL of the update site:

plugin, which is usually more compatible with development and beta releases of
Vaadin Framework, you can use https://vaadin.com/eclipse/experimental and give it a
distinctive name such as "Vaadin Experimental Site". Then click [guibutton]#OK#.
The Vaadin site should now appear in the [guilabel]#Available Software# window.

[[getting-started.eclipse.notification.overview]]
== Notification Center


The notification center is a feature of the Vaadin Eclipse plug-in. It displays
notifications about new Vaadin releases as well as news about upcoming events,
such as webinars. The notification center can be connected to your Vaadin
account.

The plug-in adds an indicator in the bottom right corner. The indicator shows
whether or not there are any pending notifications. The indicator turns red when there are new notifications.

Clicking the tray icon opens up the pop-up, as shown
in <<figure.getting-started.eclipse.notification-center.overview>>.

Clicking on the [guilabel]#Clear All# icon in the main pop-up clears all notifications and marks them all as read.

[[getting-started.eclipse.notification.signin]]
=== Signing in

The notification center uses your Vaadin account to determine
which notifications you have acknowledged as read. If you want to keep
the notification center in sync with your Vaadin account, you can sign in. If
you have read a notification on the site, it will be marked as read in the
notification center and vice versa.

When you are not signed in, the top-most notification will be a
notification that asks you to sign in.

.The sign-in notification

in <<figure.getting-started.eclipse.notification-center.complex-signin>>.

[[installing.eclipse.update]]
== Updating the Plugins

If you have automatic updates enabled in Eclipse (see "Window > Preferences >
Install/Update > Automatic Updates"), the Vaadin plugin will be updated
automatically along with other plugins. Otherwise, you can update the Vaadin
plugin manually as follows:

. Select "Help > Check for Updates".
Eclipse will contact the update sites of the installed software.

. After the updates are installed, Eclipse will ask to restart itself.
Click [guibutton]#Restart#.

Notice that updating the Vaadin plugin only updates the plugin and __not__ the
Vaadin libraries, which are project specific. See below for instructions for
updating the libraries.
