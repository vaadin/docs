= Automatic Restart with Jetty Maven Plugin

The https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/jetty-9/index.html#jetty-maven-plugin[Jetty Maven plugin] with the `scanIntervalSeconds` configuration set to a positive value performs complete application restart when the given number of seconds have elapsed since the last Java change.
For instance:

[source,xml]
----
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
        <artifactId>jetty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>9.4.27.v20200227</version>
        <configuration>
            <scanIntervalSeconds>2</scanIntervalSeconds>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>

    <!-- more plugins -->
</plugins>

[NOTE]
We recommend using Jetty Maven Plugin `9.4.27.v20200227` or higher.
A known issue in older versions causes `RouteNotFoundException` when reloading.

Since the plugin performs a full server restart, all Java changes are picked up.
This includes modifications to server startup listeners as well as changes to code that connects frontend and backend components, such as adding a new `LitTemplate` class, or adding a new CSS import and using it in Java via `@CssImport` annotation.

However, the session is not preserved during the restart.
