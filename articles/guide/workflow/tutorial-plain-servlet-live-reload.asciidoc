= Live Reload in Web Applications

During application development the code changes happen frequently. There are multiple tools
available which speed up the development process and avoid having to manually
restart the application every time after a change.

Here is a list of some of these tools:

- The https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/jetty-maven-plugin.html[Jetty Maven plugin]
with the `scanIntervalSeconds` configuration enabled.

- The commercial https://www.jrebel.com/[JRebel tool] may be used with any Java application including web applications

- http://hotswapagent.org/[HostSwapAgent] also may be used with any Java application

HostSwapAgent has issues with existing route target reloading and
we don't recommend it at the moment for this reason..

== Java modifications that are applied automatically

=== Jetty Maven plugin with `scanInterval`

Jetty Maven Plugin performs complete application restart and as a result any Java code modification
is applied including changes made to a custom component (`PolymerTemplate` subclasses): add/change/remove.

During those changes the session is not preserved.

=== JRebel

JRebel tool only applies changes in the binaries, as a result:
- it works faster
- it doesn't handle properly newly added custom components

JRebel preserves the session.

== Frontend resources modifications

As noted in the previous section it's possible to add a new `PolymerTemplate` class
to an existing JS template module or add a new JS module (see <<../polymer-templates/tutorial-template-basic#,Creating A Simple Component Using the Template API>>).

=== Jetty Maven plugin with `scanInterval`
The working scenarios are:
- add a new CSS import (as a frontend resource and use it in Java via `@CssImport` annotation)
- add a new frontend JS module file (and use it with a Java class)
- modify the existing frontend resource (JS module or imported CSS file)

In the latter case webpack dev server cares about changes made in the JS module only.

=== JRebel

JRebel only supports reloading of Java code changes, whereas client resource
changes are monitored by `webpack-dev-server`. Changes in either are live-reloaded
independently, meaning that changes to the annotations mapping JS templates or CSS
files to Java classes require a full server restart to keep the front-end and back-end consistent.

== Changes that requires application restart

All changes described above applied automatically only assuming you don't add
new dependencies to the project. The modifications which rely anyhow on updated
classpath dependencies requires the application restart.
