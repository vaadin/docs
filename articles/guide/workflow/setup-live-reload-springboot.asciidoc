= Live Reload with Spring Boot Developer Tools

For Vaadin application based on Spring Boot, Live Reload by default uses https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.0.RELEASE/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-devtools[Spring Boot Developer Tools] to automatically restart the server whenever classpath entries are updated.

The restart is significantly faster than a manual restart, as it uses a customized classloader that reloads only the application's own classes.
Basically all Java code modifications are applied, including changes in the internal application logic, route modification (adding / removing / updating routes), and changes made to custom components (`PolymerTemplate` subclasses).
The session is also preserved during the restart.
Modifications which rely on updated classpath dependencies require a full application restart.

== Step-by-step guide

. Ensure that `spring-boot-devtools` is a dependency in the application's `pom.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
. Run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run` (requires forking the JVM, which is the default mode) or via the `Application` class.
. Open the application in the browser, make some Java code changes, recompile, and the browser will refresh automatically.
+
[NOTE]
====
Uninstall or disable any other browser extensions that refresh on Spring Dev Tools reload.
As the Vaadin client also refreshes, having both active might lead to unexpected behaviour.

== [#configuration]#Additional configuration#

If during server restart you notice spurious errors like `Could not navigate to ...` or `Error creating bean with name ...`,  or you frequently see multiple restarts from a single code change, the problem may be file monitoring triggering the restart prematurely, before all updated files have been written.
The polling interval and quiet time can be configured in the `application.properties` file:

----
spring.devtools.restart.poll-interval=2s
spring.devtools.restart.quiet-period=1s
----

Higher values improve stability at the cost of a higher-latency restart cycle.
