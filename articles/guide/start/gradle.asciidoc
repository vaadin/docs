= Starting a Gradle Project

[.introText]
Gradle is a popular build tool for Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and other projects.
It is an alternative to using Maven, and in many ways much more simple to use, while also more powerful if need be.
You can use it to build a Vaadin application, run it, and manage dependencies during development.

This tutorial describes how to create, compile, and run a Vaadin application using the Vaadin Gradle Plugin.
For running the application, we use the *Gretty Plugin* to run it in an embedded web server.

More information about the Vaadin Gradle Plugin is available at the repository at https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-gradle-plugin[github.com/vaadin/vaadin-gradle-plugin].
For information about the general usage of Gradle, please refer to the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html[Gradle User Manual] at https://docs.gradle.org[docs.gradle.org].

== Requirements

The Gradle plugin has the following requirements:

* Windows, Mac, or Linux
* Java SDK 8 or newer
* Gradle 5 or 6 (or use provided wrapper from the example projects)
** Install it from https://gradle.org/install
* Node.js and npm (can also be installed locally to project using the Vaadin Gradle Plugin)

Except for Gradle, these are general Vaadin requirements, as described in https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/installing/installing-overview.html[Installing Development Tools].

== Creating a Vaadin Project

To create a new project, the easiest way is to clone a starter repository containing an application skeleton.

You can also take any existing Vaadin project and make a `build.gradle` file for it, as described in <<build-file, "The Build File">>.

=== Cloning a Starter Repository

The following starter repositories are available at the moment:

`link:https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-gradle[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-gradle]`::
  A minimalistic web application project to be deployed as a WAR package.
+
[subs="normal"]
----
$ git clone pass:[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-gradle] _my-project_
----

`link:https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-spring-gradle[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-spring-gradle]`::
  A web application project skeleton that uses Spring Boot.
+
[subs="normal"]
----
$ git clone pass:[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-spring-gradle] _my-project_
----

=== Starter Project Contents

Once cloned, the project should look as follows (imported in the Eclipse IDE):

[#newproject-image]
.Cloned Starter Project
image::images/gradle-project-created-annotated.png[Image,100%]

The most important files and folders are as follows:

`src/main/java/<package>/MainView.java`::
  The application view class for the root route, built from components.

`src/main/java/<package>/GreetService.java`::
  A trivial service object to separate business data and logic from the view.

`frontend/src`::
  Folder for HTML templates and JavaScript code.
  See the README inside for more details.

`frontend/styles/shared-styles.css`::
  Application-specific style sheets to style the overall look of the application.

`frontend/styles/vaadin-text-field-styles.css`::
  An example to modify the style of the *TextField* component.

`build.gradle`::
  The gradle build file as described below in <<build-file>>.

`gradlew` and `gradlew.bat`::
  Gradle wrapper build scripts for Linux/Mac (`gradlew`) and Windows (`gradlew.bat`).
  The build scripts allow building the project without Gradle preinstalled.

[[build-file]]
== The Build File

The `build.gradle` file needs to at least enable the Vaadin Gradle Plugin:

----
plugins {
    id 'com.vaadin' version '0.8.0' <1>

    // Optional
    id 'org.gretty' version '3.0.3' <2>
    id 'war' <3>
    id 'groovy' <4>
}
----
<1> Use the plugin version of your choice.
+
Please see the releases at https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-gradle-plugin/releases[github.com/vaadin/vaadin-gradle-plugin] for the latest release.
<2> Use the Gretty embedded web server for running the application during development.
See <<running>> for details.
<3> Build a WAR package to deploy to a traditional Servlet container.
You also need to define Servlet API using `providedCompile "javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:3.1.0"` in the dependencies section.
<4> By default the plugin supports Java.
You can include Groovy or Kotlin with the optional plugin.

[[build-file.vaadin-options]]
=== Vaadin Plugin Configuration

Vaadin Gradle Plugin options are configured in a `vaadin` block.

Usually, you have it as follows during development:

----
vaadin {
    optimizeBundle = false
}
----

If the parameter is set `true`, the front-end bundle is optimized for all supported browsers, but compilation is much slower.

Other configuration options, with their default values, are as follows:

`productionMode = false`::
  Whether the project is compiled for production.
  For production, the front-end is transpiled for older browsers and optimized, as described in https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/production/tutorial-production-mode-basic.html[Taking your Application into Production].
  It is a slow, so it is not normally done during development.
  Running the `vaadinBuildFrontend` task will automatically switch this to `true`, so there is no need for you to configure anything.
+
See also <<production>>.

`buildOutputDirectory = File(project.buildDir, "vaadin-generated")`::
  The plugin will generate additional resource files in the given directory.
  These files need to be present on the classpath, in order for Vaadin to be able to run, both in the develoment and production mode.
  The plugin will automatically register it as an additional resource directory, which should then be picked up by the IDE.
  That allows the application to be deployed, for example, to Tomcat in IntelliJ or Eclipse IDE.
  For example, the `flow-build-info.json` goes in the directory.
  See the `webpackOutputDirectory` parameter below for more details.

`webpackOutputDirectory = File(buildOutputDirectory, "META-INF/VAADIN/")`::
  The folder where webpack should output `index.js` and other generated files.
  In the development mode, the `flow-build-info.json` file is generated here.

`npmFolder: File = project.projectDir`::
  The folder where the `package.json` file is located.
  The file lists the npm packages and their versions your project depends on.
  It is by default located at the project root directory.

`webpackTemplate: String = "webpack.config.js"`::
  Copy the `webapp.config.js` file from the specified URL if missing.
  The default is a template provided by this plugin.
  Set it to empty string to disable the feature.

`webpackGeneratedTemplate = "webpack.generated.js"`::
  Copy the webapp.generated.js from the specified URL.
  Default is the template provided by this plugin.
  Set it to empty string to disable the feature.

`generatedFolder = File(project.projectDir, "target/frontend")`::
  The folder where flow will put generated files that will be used by webpack.
  Should be `build/frontend/`, but that is only supported in Vaadin 15+.

`frontendDirectory = File(project.projectDir, "frontend")`::
  The directory with the frontend source files of the project.

`generateBundle = true`::
  Whether to generate a bundle from the project frontend sources or not.

`runNpmInstall = true`::
  Whether to run npm install after updating dependencies.

`generateEmbeddableWebComponents = true`::
  Whether to generate embeddable web components from WebComponentExporter inheritors.

`frontendResourcesDirectory = File(project.projectDir, "src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/frontend")`::
  Defines the project frontend directory from where resources should be copied from for use with webpack.

`optimizeBundle = true`::
  Whether to use byte code scanner strategy to discover frontend components.

`nodeVersion = "12.14.1"`::
  When using the `vaadinPrepareNode` task, this property specifies which node version to download.
  Please see the list of all node.js releases.
  Usually it is best to select the latest LTS release.


[[build-file.repositories]]
=== Configuring Repositories

The `repositories` section defines the locations to search for packages.
Normally, you need at least the a repository holding Vaadin libraries.
They are available at least through `jcenter`.

----
repositories {
  jcenter()
}
----

You can use any Gradle repository definitions in the block.
See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html[Declaring repositories] in Gradle documentation for more information.

[[build-file.dependencies]]
=== Configuring Dependencies

You need to add the `vaadin-core` library as a Java dependency:

----
dependencies {
  implementation "com.vaadin:vaadin-core:14.+"
}
----

With `14.+` version specification, you choose to use the latest version of Vaadin 14, but you can also give exact version.

See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html[Declaring dependencies] in Gradle documentation for further details.

[[build-file.other]]
=== Other Configuration

In the starter project, we define default targets for convenience, so that you can simply run `gradle` without specifying any tasks:

----
defaultTasks("clean", "vaadinBuildFrontend", "build")
----

[[compiling]]
== Compiling

If you defined the default tasks as described above in <<build-file.other>>, you can simply do:

----
$ gradle
----

Otherwise, you normally build the project with the standard `build` task.
However, on the first time and also otherwise if it is necessary, you need to build the Vaadin frontend.

----
$ gradle vaadinBuildFrontend build
----

[[compiling.tasks]]
=== Vaadin Tasks

The Vaadin-related tasks handled by the plugin are as follows:

`vaadinBuildFrontend`::
  Builds the front-end bundle with the webpack utility.
  Vaadin front-end resources, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and images, are bundled to optimize loading the front-end.
  This task is not executed automatically on the `build` and other targets, so you need to run it explicitly.

`vaadinClean`::
  Cleans the project completely and removes `node_modules`, `package*.json`, and `webpack.*.js`.
  You need to run this task if you upgrade Vaadin version and in other such situations.

`vaadinPrepareFrontend`::
  Checks that node.js and npm are installed, copies frontend resources, and creates or updates `package.json` and `webpack.config.json` files.
  The frontend resources are inside `.jar` dependencies, and copied to `node_modules`.

`vaadinPrepareNode`::
  Prepares a local node distribution for use by Vaadin.
  The task requires the optional `com.github.node-gradle.node` plugin, which you need to specify in the `plugins` section.

To get the complete list of tasks handled by the configured plugins, enter:

----
$ gradle tasks
----

[[running]]
== Running the Application

For running the application during development, the Gradle plugin supports the Gretty plugin, which runs the application in an embedded web server.
You can do that either in an IDE or at command-line as follows.

See https://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/index.html[Gretty documentation] for a complete reference on using Gretty.

One way to enable the Gretty plugin is in the `plugin` section of the `gradle.build` file, as we do in the starter project:

----
plugins {
  ...
  id 'org.gretty' version '3.0.1'
}
----

You can configure Gretty further in an optional `gretty` block:

----
gretty {
    contextPath = "/" <1>
    servletContainer = "jetty9.4" <2>
}
----
<1> Sets the context path to root path.
The default context path contains the project name, so the URL would be `http://localhost:8080/myproject` (or whatever your project name is).
<2> Use Jetty as the servlet container, with the specified version.

To run the application, simply run the `appRun` task:

----
 $ gradle appRun
----

The task compiles the application and starts the web server in `http://localhost:8080/` (assuming that you configured the root context path as described above).

== Developing in the Eclipse IDE

Gradle has first-class support at least in the Eclipse IDE, IDEA, NetBeans, and Android Studio.
In the following, we go through how to create, import, and develop a Vaadin Gradle project in the Eclipse IDE.

=== Importing a New Project

You create a new Vaadin project either by cloning the repository on command-line and importing it to Eclipse as a Gradle project.

. Clone the starter repository of you choice as described earlier.
. Select *menu:File[Import > Gradle > Existing Gradle Project]*.
. Enter or select the *Project root directory*.
. Click *Finish*.

The project should appear in the *Project Eplorer* and look like depicted in <<newproject-image>>.

You should now see the *Gradle Tasks* tab; you can browse all the various available tasks.

.Gradle Tasks tab in Eclipse
image::images/gradle-eclipse-tasks.png[Image,100%]

=== Running the Application

You can run the project using Gretty in an embedded web server.

. Open the *Gradle Tasks* tab
. Double-click the `gretty` -> `appRun` task
** The *Gradle Executions* tab opens and shows build progress
. When the `:apprun` task is running, open the browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
. To stop the server go to the *Console* tab and press any key.

[[production]]
== Going to Production

To build a web application as a WAR package, you need the `war` plugin.
You also need to enable it.

In `build.gradle`, you need to include the plugin and enable WAR build:
----
plugins {
  ...
  id 'war'
}

war {
    enabled=true
}
----

When making a production-ready build, the Vaadin Gradle Plugin transpiles the client-side dependencies to legacy browsers, as described in https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/production/tutorial-production-mode-basic.html[Taking your Application into Production].
You enable that by either setting it in `build.gradle` or at command-line when invoking Gradle.

In `build.gradle`:

----
vaadin {
   productionMode = true
}
----

At command-line:

----
$ gradle -DproductionMode=true war
----
