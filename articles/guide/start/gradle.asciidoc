= Starting a Vaadin Project With Gradle

[.introText]
Gradle is a popular build tool for Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and other projects.
It is an alternative to using Maven, and in many ways much more simple to use, while also more powerful if need be.
You can use it to build a Vaadin application, run it, and manage dependencies during development.

This tutorial describes how to create, compile, and run a Vaadin application using the Vaadin Gradle Plugin.
For running the application, the *Gretty Plugin* is used to run it in an embedded web server.

More information about the Vaadin Gradle Plugin is available at the https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-gradle-plugin[Vaadin Gradle plugin repository].
For information about the general usage of Gradle, please refer to the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html[Gradle User Manual].

== Requirements

The Gradle plugin has the following requirements:

* Windows, Mac, or Linux
* Java SDK 8 or newer
* Gradle 5 or 6 (or use provided wrapper from the example projects)
** Install it from https://gradle.org/install
* Node.js and npm (can also be installed locally to project using the Vaadin Gradle Plugin)

Except for Gradle, these are general Vaadin requirements, as described in <<{articles}/guide/install#,Installing Development Tools>>.

== Creating a Vaadin Project

To create a new project, the easiest way is to clone a starter repository containing an application skeleton.

You can also take any existing Vaadin project and make a `build.gradle` file for it, as described in <<build-file, "The Build File">>.

=== Cloning a Starter Repository

The following starter repositories are available at the moment:

`link:https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-gradle[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-gradle]`::
  A simple web application project to be deployed as a WAR package.
+
[subs="normal"]
----
$ git clone pass:[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-gradle] _my-project_
----

`link:https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-spring-gradle[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-spring-gradle]`::
  A web application project skeleton that uses Spring Boot.
+
[subs="normal"]
----
$ git clone pass:[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-spring-gradle] _my-project_
----

=== Starter Project Contents

Once cloned, the project should look as follows (imported in the Eclipse IDE):

[#newproject-image]
.Cloned Starter Project
image::_images/gradle-project-created-annotated.png[Contents of a Gradle based project]

The most important files and folders are as follows:

`src/main/java/<package>/MainView.java`::
  The application view class for the root route, built from components.

`src/main/java/<package>/GreetService.java`::
  A trivial service object to separate business data and logic from the view.

`frontend/src`::
  Folder for HTML templates and JavaScript code.
  See the README inside for more details.

`frontend/styles/shared-styles.css`::
  Application-specific style sheets to style the look of the application.

`frontend/styles/vaadin-text-field-styles.css`::
  An example to modify the style of the `TextField` component.

`build.gradle`::
  The Gradle build file as described below in <<build-file>>.

`gradlew` and `gradlew.bat`::
  Gradle wrapper build scripts for Linux/Mac (`gradlew`) and Windows (`gradlew.bat`).
  The build scripts allow building the project without Gradle preinstalled.

[[build-file]]
== The Build File

The `build.gradle` file needs to at least enable the Vaadin Gradle Plugin:

----
plugins {
    id 'com.vaadin' version '20.0.0' <1>

    // Optional
    id 'org.gretty' version '3.0.3' <2>
    id 'war' <3>
    id 'groovy' <4>
}
----
<1> Use the plugin version matching the Vaadin version.
+
Please see the releases at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases[github.com/vaadin/platform] for the latest release.
+
To try the pre-release version of the plugin see <<pre-release,Using Plugin pre-release Version>>
<2> Use the Gretty embedded web server for running the application during development.
See <<running>> for details.
<3> Build a `WAR` package to deploy to a traditional Servlet container.
You also need to define Servlet API using `providedCompile "javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:3.1.0"` in the dependencies section.
<4> By default the plugin supports Java.
You can include Groovy or Kotlin as an optional plugin.

[[build-file.vaadin-options]]
=== Vaadin Plugin Configuration

Vaadin Gradle Plugin options are configured in a `vaadin` block.

Usually it is as follows during development:

----
vaadin {
    optimizeBundle = false
}
----

If the parameter is `true`, the frontend bundle is optimized for all supported browsers, but compilation is much slower.

For configuration options see <<all-options,plugin configuration options>>


[[build-file.repositories]]
=== Configuring Repositories

The `repositories` section defines the locations to search for packages.
At least the repository holding Vaadin libraries is needed.
They are available from `jcenter`.

----
repositories {
  jcenter()
}
----

You can use any Gradle repository definitions in the block.
See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html[Declaring repositories] in Gradle documentation for more information.

[[build-file.dependencies]]
=== Configuring Dependencies

You need to add `vaadin-core` or `vaadin` library as a Java dependency:

----
dependencies {
  implementation "com.vaadin:vaadin-core:20.+"
}
----

With `20.+` version specification, you choose to use the latest version of Vaadin, but you can also give exact version.

See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html[Declaring dependencies] in Gradle documentation for further details.

[[build-file.other]]
=== Other Configuration

In the starter project, default targets are defined for convenience, so that you can run `gradle` without specifying any tasks:

----
defaultTasks("clean", "vaadinBuildFrontend", "build")
----

[[compiling]]
== Compiling

If you defined the default tasks as described above in <<build-file.other>>, you can run:

----
$ gradle
----

Otherwise, the project builds with the standard `build` task.
However, on the first time and also otherwise if it is necessary, you need to build the Vaadin frontend.

----
$ gradle vaadinBuildFrontend build
----

[[compiling.tasks]]
=== Vaadin Tasks

The Vaadin-related tasks handled by the plugin are as follows:

`vaadinPrepareFrontend`::
  Checks that `node.js` and `npm` are installed, copies frontend resources, and creates or updates `package.json` and `webpack.config.json` files.
  The frontend resources are inside `.jar` dependencies, and copied to `node_modules`.

`vaadinBuildFrontend`::
  Builds the frontend bundle with the webpack utility.
  Vaadin frontend resources, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and images, are bundled to optimize loading the frontend.
  This task is not executed automatically on the `build` and other targets, so you need to run it explicitly.

`vaadinClean`::
  Cleans the project and removes `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `webpack.generated.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `types.d.ts`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpmfile.js`.
  You need to run this task if you upgrade Vaadin version and in other such situations.

To get the complete list of tasks handled by the configured plugins, enter:

----
$ gradle tasks
----

[[running]]
== Running the Application

For running the application during development, the Gradle plugin supports the Gretty plugin, which runs the application in an embedded web server.
You can do that either in an IDE or at command-line as follows.

See https://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/index.html[Gretty documentation] for a complete reference on using Gretty.

One way to enable the Gretty plugin is in the `plugin` section of the `gradle.build` file, as in the starter project:

----
plugins {
  ...
  id 'org.gretty' version '3.0.3'
}
----

You can configure Gretty further in an optional `gretty` block:

----
gretty {
    contextPath = "/" <1>
    servletContainer = "jetty9.4" <2>
}
----
<1> Sets the context path to root path.
The default context path contains the project name, so the URL would be `http://localhost:8080/myproject` (or whatever your project name is).
<2> Use Jetty as the servlet container, with the specified version.

The application is started with the `appRun` task:

----
 $ gradle appRun
----

The task compiles the application and starts the web server in `http://localhost:8080/` (if the root context path is configured as described above).

== Developing in the Eclipse IDE

Gradle has first-class support at least in the Eclipse IDE, IDEA, NetBeans, and Android Studio.
The following part explores how to create, import, and develop a Vaadin Gradle project in the Eclipse IDE.

=== Importing a New Project

You create a new Vaadin project either by cloning the repository on command-line and importing it to Eclipse as a Gradle project.

. Clone the starter repository of you choice as described earlier.
. Select *menu:File[Import > Gradle > Existing Gradle Project]*.
. Enter or select the *Project root directory*.
. Click *Finish*.

The project should appear in the *Project Explorer* and look like depicted in <<newproject-image>>.

You should now see the *Gradle Tasks* tab; you can browse all the various available tasks.

.Gradle Tasks tab in Eclipse
image::_images/gradle-eclipse-tasks.png[Gradle Tasks tab in eclipse]

=== Running the Application

You can run the project using Gretty in an embedded web server.

. Open the *Gradle Tasks* tab
. Double-click the `gretty` -> `appRun` task
** The *Gradle Executions* tab opens and shows build progress
. When the `:apprun` task is running, open the browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
. To stop the server go to the *Console* tab and press any key.

[[production]]
== Going to Production

To build a web application as a WAR package, you need the `war` plugin.
You also need to enable it.

In `build.gradle`, you need to include the plugin and enable `WAR` build:
----
plugins {
  ...
  id 'war'
}

war {
    enabled=true
}
----

When making a production-ready build, the Vaadin Gradle Plugin transpiles the client-side dependencies to legacy browsers, as described in <<{articles}/guide/production#,Deploying to Production>>.
You enable that by either setting it in `build.gradle` or at command-line when invoking Gradle.

In `build.gradle`:

----
vaadin {
   productionMode = true
}
----

At command-line:

----
$ gradle -Pvaadin.productionMode=true war
----

[[pre-release]]
== Using Plugin Snapshot Version

A snapshot version of the plugin is pushed to the pre-release repository.

To use the pre-released plugin add the `vaadin-prereleases` repository to the project `settings.gradle` file.

.Plugin repository added to settings file
----
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven { url = 'https://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-prereleases' }
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
----

Then the plugin needs to be defined and applied in the `build.gradle` file.

.Define snapshot plugin
----
buildscript {
    ...
    dependencies {
        classpath group: 'com.vaadin',
                name: 'vaadin-gradle-plugin',
                version: '20.0-SNAPSHOT'
    }
}

plugins {
    ...
}

apply plugin: 'com.vaadin'
----

[[all-options]]
== Plugin Configuration Options

In this list are all configuration options with their default values:

`productionMode: Boolean = false`::
Define if application is running in productionMode.
Defaults to false.
For production, the frontend is transpiled for older browsers and optimized, as described in <<{articles}/guide/production#,Deploying to Production>>.
Running the `vaadinBuildFrontend` task automatically switches this to `true`, so there is no need to configure anything.

`webpackOutputDirectory: File? = null`::
The folder where webpack should output `index.js` and other generated files.
Defaults to `null` which uses the automatically detected value of the main SourceSet, usually `build/resources/main/META-INF/VAADIN/webapp/`.

`npmFolder: File = project.projectDir`::
The folder where `package.json` file is located.
Default is project root dir.

`webpackTemplate: String = FrontendUtils.WEBPACK_CONFIG`::
Copy the `webapp.config.js` from the specified URL if missing.
Default is the template provided by this plugin.
Set it to empty string to disable the feature.

`webpackGeneratedTemplate: String = FrontendUtils.WEBPACK_GENERATED`::
Copy the `webapp.generated.js` from the specified URL.
Default is the template provided by this plugin.
Set it to empty string to disable the feature.

`generatedFolder: File(project.projectDir, "target/frontend")`::
Target folder for generated files used by webpack.

`frontendDirectory: File(project.projectDir, "frontend")`::
The directory with the frontend source files of the project.

Generate a bundle from the project frontend sources if true.

`runNpmInstall: Boolean = true`::
Run `npm install` after updating dependencies.

`generateEmbeddableWebComponents: Boolean = true`::
Generate web components from WebComponentExporter inheritors.

`frontendResourcesDirectory: File = File(project.projectDir, Constants.LOCAL_FRONTEND_RESOURCES_PATH)`::
Defines the project frontend directory from where resources should be copied from for use with webpack.

`optimizeBundle: Boolean = true`::
Use byte code scanner strategy to discover frontend components.

`pnpmEnable: Boolean = true`::
Instructs to use pnpm for installing npm frontend resources.
Default is true

`requireHomeNodeExec: Boolean = false`::
Whether vaadin home node executable usage is forced.
If it's set to `true` then vaadin home 'node' is checked and installed if absent.
This is then be used instead of globally or locally installed 'node'.

`useDeprecatedV14Bootstrapping: Boolean = false`::
Defines if the application should run in legacy V14 bootstrap mode.
Defaults to false.

`eagerServerLoad: Boolean = false`::
Define if the initial UIDL object is added to the bootstrap `index.html`.
Defaults to false.

`applicationProperties: File = File(project.projectDir, "src/main/resources/application.properties")`::
Application properties file in Spring project.

Java source folders for connect scanning.

`generatedTsFolder: File = File(project.projectDir, "frontend/generated")`::
Folder where Flow puts TS API files for client projects.

`nodeVersion: String = "v14.15.4"`::
The `node.js` version to be used when `node.js` is installed automatically by Vaadin, for example `"v14.15.4"`.
Defaults to `[FrontendTools.DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION]`.

`nodeDownloadRoot: String = "https://nodejs.org/dist/"`::
URL to download `node.js` from.
This can be needed in corporate environments where the `node.js` download is provided from an intranet mirror.
Defaults to `[NodeInstaller.DEFAULT_NODEJS_DOWNLOAD_ROOT]`.

`resourceOutputDirectory: File = File(project.buildDir, "vaadin-generated")`::
Define the output directory for generated non-served resources, such as the token file.
Defaults to `build/vaadin-generated` folder.
