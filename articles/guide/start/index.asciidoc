The recommended way to start a new Vaadin project is to use *{wizard-name}*.
It allows you to configure and download a customized starting point for your application.

Choose whether to build your application using <<{articles}/flow/overview#,Flow>> or <<{articles}/fusion/overview#,Fusion>>.

.You can change your mind later
[NOTE]
Don't worry about making "a wrong choice".
You can switch between Flow and Fusion in a project later if you want to.

=== Start With Flow

Build your application entirely using Java.

[.card.large]
=== Start With Fusion
image::../../_images/fusion.svg[opts=inline, role=icon]
Build your backend services using Java and UIs using TypeScript and HTML.

=== Non-Spring Boot Starters
The applications created using {wizard-name} are based on Spring Boot.
Vaadin Flow starters for other stacks, such as JavaEE or plain servlet, are available in GitHub.
Note that Fusion only works with a Spring Boot project.

== Next Steps

Once you have downloaded a starter project and have it extracted in a local folder, you can import it to your favorite IDE (integrated development environment) and start developing it further.

.Ways to create and run a new project

If you create a project outside an IDE, you need to import it in the IDE.
During development, you can run the project with a Maven target, depending on the technology stack you are using.

After you have the project in your IDE, you can go ahead and run or debug it.
