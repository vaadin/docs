= Starting a Project
:wizard-name: Vaadin Start
:toclevels: 2

The recommended way to start a new Vaadin project is to use *{wizard-name}*. It allows you to configure and download a customized starting point for an application.

== Vaadin Start Features

Vaadin Start allows you to configure and download a Vaadin project. You can then use this project as a starting point to create your own Vaadin application.

Among other things, Vaadin Start enables you to do the following:

* *Add several views to the application.* You can select the initial content of each view from a list of more than fifteen templates. For example, you can include views based on the Master-Detail template, which can be used to manage the data of an entity.

* *Add and modify JPA entities.* These entities are downloaded with the generated project, along with their corresponding Spring Data classes, such as the [classname]`Repository` and [classname]`Service` classes.

* *Set up security and configure access control.* These can be configured for a specific view or the entire app.

* *Change the look and feel of the application.* Specifically, you can adjust the application's colors, typography, style, sizing, and spacing.

* *Add helpful project settings.* With this, for example, you can generate the deployment files for Docker and Kubernetes, or you can select between H2 and PostgreSQL as the database to use for the project.

== Non-Spring Boot Starters

Applications created using {wizard-name} are based on Spring Boot. You can find Vaadin Flow starters for other technology stacks, such as JakartaEE, or plain servlet on GitHub.

== Next Steps

Once you've downloaded a starter project and have extracted it in a local folder, you can import it to your favorite integrated development environment (IDE) and start developing it.

If you create a project outside an IDE, you need to import it into the IDE. During development, you can run the project with a Maven target, depending on the technology stack you're using. After you have the project in your IDE, you can run or debug it.
