= Starting a Project
:wizard-name: Vaadin Start
:toclevels: 2

The recommended way to start a new Vaadin project is to use *{wizard-name}*.
It allows you to configure and download a customized starting point for your application.

== Vaadin Start Features

Vaadin Start allows you to configure and download a Vaadin project.
Then, you can use this project as a starting point to create your own Vaadin application.

Among other things, Vaadin Start enables you to:

* *Add several views to the application.* You can select the initial content of each view from a list of 15+ templates.
For example, you can include views based on the Master-Detail template, which can be used to manage the data of an entity.

* *Add and modify JPA entities.*
These entities are downloaded with the generated project, along with their corresponding Spring Data classes, such as the [classname]`Repository` and [classname]`Service` classes.

* *Set up security and configure access control.*
These can be configured for a specific view or the entire app.

* *Change the look and feel of the application.*
Specifically, you can adjust the application's colors, typography, style, sizing, and spacing.

For example, you can:
** Generate the deployment files for Docker and Kubernetes.
** Select between H2 and PostgreSQL as the database to use for the project.

== Non-Spring Boot Starters

The applications created using {wizard-name} are based on Spring Boot.
Vaadin Flow starters for other stacks, such as JavaEE or plain servlet, are available in GitHub.

== Next Steps

Once you have downloaded a starter project and have it extracted in a local folder, you can import it to your favorite integrated development environment (IDE) and start developing it further.

If you create a project outside an IDE, you need to import it into the IDE.
During development, you can run the project with a Maven target, depending on the technology stack you are using.

After you have the project in your IDE, you can go ahead and run or debug it.
