= Configuration Properties

[.lead]
Vaadin applications have configuration properties that change its behavior.
Use either system properties or servlet initialization parameters to set them.

See the <<properties,full list of properties>>.

For Spring-based applications, there are <<{articles}/flow/integrations/spring/configuration#, Spring specific instructions available>>.

== Using System Properties

When using Java's system properties to set the Vaadin application parameters,
the `vaadin.` prefix is needed to be specified before the parameter names.
The following shows and example of setting the system property when executing
a Maven goal from the command line:

----
mvn jetty:run -Dvaadin.frontend.url.es6=http://mydomain.com/es6/ -Dvaadin.frontend.url.es5=http://mydomain.com/es5/
----

System properties can be configured for Maven plugin executions. For instance, the following
example sets a Vaadin specific system property when the Jetty Maven plugin is run:

[source, XML]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
    <artifactId>jetty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <systemProperties>
            <systemProperty>
                <name>vaadin.pushMode</name>
                <value>disabled</value>
            </systemProperty>
        </systemProperties>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

== Using Servlet Initialization Parameters

Another alternative is to use servlet initialization parameters.
You can use the Servlet 3.0 `@WebServlet` annotation, which requires you to configure
your own servlet (otherwise it is done automatically by Vaadin with default parameter values):

[source, Java]
----
@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/*", name = "myservlet", asyncSupported = true, initParams = {
        @WebInitParam(name = "frontend.url.es6", value = "http://mydomain.com/es6/"),
        @WebInitParam(name = "frontend.url.es5", value = "http://mydomain.com/es5/") })
@VaadinServletConfiguration(productionMode = false)
public class MyServlet extends VaadinServlet {
}
----

Yet another approach is to use the `web.xml` file:

[source, XML]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app
  id="WebApp_ID" version="3.0"
  xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
      http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd">

  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>myservlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>
        com.vaadin.server.VaadinServlet
    </servlet-class>

    <init-param>
      <param-name>frontend.url.es6</param-name>
      <param-value>http://mydomain.com/es6/</param-value>
    </init-param>

    <init-param>
      <param-name>frontend.url.es5</param-name>
      <param-value>http://mydomain.com/es5/</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>myservlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
----

.System properties override servlet parameters
[NOTE]
If you have both properties with the same name specified, the system one will be used.

[[properties]]
== Configuration Properties

The list contains the properties that are defined in `com.vaadin.server.DeploymentConfiguration` and `com.vaadin.server.Constants` classes, in alphabetical order.

.Spring Boot
[NOTE]
If you use Spring Boot then you should add the prefix `vaadin.`, for example, `vaadin.productionMode=true`.

`closeIdleSessions`::
When set to true (the default is false), the session is be closed if no UI is active.
Heartbeat requests are like any other request from the servlet container’s viewpoint.
This means that as long as there is an open UI, the session never expires even though there is no user interaction.
You can control this behavior by setting an init parameter named closeIdleSessions to true.

`devmode.liveReload.enabled`::
This is by default set to `true`, which means that if you are using some live reload tool on the server side the browser is refreshed automatically once code is reloaded on the server side.

`devmode.optimizeBundle`::
By default, in development mode all frontend resources found on the class path are included in the generated Webpack bundle.
When set to `true`, creates an optimized bundle by including only frontend resources that are used from the application entry points (this is the default in production mode).
Uses bytecode scanning which increases application startup time.

`disable.automatic.servlet.registration`::
Configuration name for the parameter that determines if Vaadin should automatically register servlets needed for the application to work.

`disable-xsrf-protection`
Cross-site request forgery protection.
This protection is enabled by default, but it might need to be disabled to allow a certain type of testing.
For these cases, the check can be disabled by setting the init parameter.

`frontend.url.es5`::
A location Vaadin searches web components' files in production mode when the request is coming
from older browsers, not supporting es6, default web components' development language version.

`frontend.url.es6`::
A location Vaadin searches web components' files in production mode for requests from modern browsers.

`heartbeatInterval`::
*Affects Flow applications only.* UIs that are open on the client side send a regular heartbeat to the server to indicate they are still alive, even though there is no ongoing user interaction.
When the server does not receive a valid heartbeat for a given UI, it will eventually remove that UI from the session.

`i18n.provider`::
I18N provider property. To use localization and translation strings the application only needs to implement `I18NProvider` and define the fully qualified class name in the property `i18n.provider`.
Please consult <<{articles}/flow/advanced/i18n-localization#, Localization>> documentation.

`load.es5.adapters`::
Include polyfills for browsers that do not support ES6 to their initial page.
For web components to work, extra libraries (polyfills) are required to be loaded, can be turned off
if different versions or libraries should be included instead.

`maxMessageSuspendTimeout`::
In certain cases, such as when the server sends adjacent `XmlHttpRequest` responses and push
messages over a low bandwidth connection, messages may be received out of order by the client.
This property specifies the maximum time (in milliseconds) that the client will then wait for
the predecessors of a received out-order message, before considering them missing and requesting
a full resynchronization of the application state from the server.
The default value is 5000 ms.
You may increase this if your application exhibits an undue amount of resynchronization requests
(as these degrade the UX due to flickering and loss of client-side-only state such as scroll position).

`original.frontend.resources`::
Configuration name for the parameter that determines if Vaadin should use bundled fragments or not.

`pnpm.enable`::
This flag can be used to enable pnpm instead of npm for resolving and downloading frontend dependencies.
By default it is `false` and npm is used, but setting it to `true` enables pnpm.
See how to <<npm-pnpm#, switch between npm and pnpm>>.

`productionMode`::
Turns application to work in production mode.
Production mode disables most of the logged information that appears on the console because logging and other debug features can have a significant performance impact.
Development mode JavaScript functions are not exported, `push` is given as a minified JavaScript file instead of full size and static resources are cached.
See <<../production#,Deploying to Production>> for more information.

`pushLongPollingSuspendTimeout`::
*Affects Flow applications only.* When using the long polling transport strategy,  it specifies how long it accepts responses after
each network request.
Number of milliseconds.

`pushMode`::
*Affects Flow applications only.* The permitted values are "disabled" or "manual". See <<{articles}/flow/advanced/server-push#, Server Push>> for more information.

`pushURL`::
*Affects Flow applications only.* The URL to use for push requests. Some servers require a predefined URL to push.
See <<{articles}/flow/advanced/server-push#, Server Push>> for more information.

`requestTiming`::
If true, in each response the server includes some basic timing information.
This can be used for performance testing.

`sendUrlsAsParameters`::
Returns whether the sending of URL's as GET and POST parameters in requests with content-type
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is enabled or not.

`syncIdCheck`::
Returns whether sync id checking is enabled.
The sync id is used to gracefully handle situations
when the client sends a message to a connector that has recently been removed on the server.
Default is `true`.
