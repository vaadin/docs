= Troubleshooting Production Mode

[.lead]
Guidance if you have problems taking Vaadin applications to production.

== Verifying the Production Mode Artifact

Vaadin Servlet configures itself from the `flow-build-info.json` file, which is located in the `META-INF/VAADIN/config/` resource package.
The location of resources differs for different artifact types, for example:

* Spring Boot jar file places resources into the `BOOT-INF/classes/` folder in the jar file;
* WAR archive places resources into the `WEB-INF/classes/` folder.

If the production mode has been activated properly, the contents of the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file should be as follows:

.flow-build-info.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "compatibilityMode": false,
  "productionMode": true,      <1>
  "enableDevServer": false,
  "chunks": {
    "fallback": {
      "jsModules": [
        "@vaadin/vaadin-icons/vaadin-icons.js",
        "@vaadin/vaadin-grid/src/vaadin-grid-tree-toggle.js",
// etc etc
        "frontend://ironListConnector.js"
      ],
      "cssImports": [
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

<1> Note that the `productionMode` property is set to `true`

It's very important to have this file on classpath in production mode exactly once.

If the file is missing, Vaadin Servlet will use other means to examine whether it's running in production mode: the value of the `vaadin.productionMode` system property, or the `flow-server-production-mode.jar` being present on the classpath, or similar.
Depending on the outcome, Vaadin may throw an exception at runtime:

----
Failed to determine project directory for dev mode...
----

or

----
The compatibility mode is explicitly set to 'false', but there are neither 'flow-build-info.json' nor 'webpack.config.js' files
----

Vaadin may also decide to start in development mode; the Vaadin configuration is then governed by a different set of rules (for example, the `project.basedir` property or similar).

The project `flow-build-info.json` file is generated by Vaadin plugin, in the `prepare-frontend` Maven goal, then modified in `build-frontend` task to enable production mode.

If the file is present multiple times on the classpath, then Vaadin tries to choose which one is the right one which should be coming from the main project.
Sometimes it's not possible to do so, and then Vaadin prints a warning message and chooses the first `flow-build-info.json` file, which depends on the classpath ordering which in turn may depend on the ordering of files on the file system or in the WAR/JAR archive.

This can happen when a Vaadin addon incorrectly includes the `flow-build-info.json` file in the jar file.
That's a bug in the addon packaging which need to be fixed and the `flow-build-info.json` file removed from addon's jar file.

For the reasons stated above, keep in mind to have the `flow-build-info.json` file on the classpath only once, and always coming from your main project.

A file named `META-INF/VAADIN/config/stats.json` is generated by Maven Plugin as well – it's important to check for the presence of this file in the resources folder.

When packaging for production a `webpack` executable is run; this happens in the `build-frontend` Maven goal.
Webpack is then responsible for packaging everything from `frontend/` and `node_modules` into
the precompiled JavaScript files bundle.
The bundle is located in the `META-INF/VAADIN/build/` resource folder.
The folder contents should look like this (the hash is going to differ on every build):

== Common Issues

After adding the `flow-server-production-mode` dependency, the application no longer starts::
One potential cause of this problem is that the `build-frontend` of the `flow-maven-plugin` was not executed, either because the plugin is missing from the `pom.xml` or it is missing configuration.
To fix this, add the `flow-maven-plugin` to your maven `build` block (make sure it is visible in your production mode profile), and enable the `build-frontend` goal.
