= Deploying Spring Boot Based Applications

https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] applications are slightly different to tradition Java web applications (or Jakarta EE applications) in that they by default create a JAR file with embedded server in it, rather than traditional WAR file that is deployed on a standalone Servlet container or fully featured Java EE server.

Alternatively, Spring Boot applications can be packaged as WAR files as well. Follow https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-create-a-deployable-war-file[the instructions in Spring Boot documentation] how to do this.

The main differences between JAR and WAR packaging are as follows:

JAR packaging:

- no need for a server binary install, a Java Runtime is all that is needed
- bigger package size

WAR packaging:

- a separate Java Servlet container needed
- free choice of servers, including Jetty, Tomcat, WildFly, GlassFish, and others
- smaller package size

See <<{articles}/flow/integrations/spring/configuration#using-spring-boot-properties,Using Spring Boot Properties>> for additional details.
