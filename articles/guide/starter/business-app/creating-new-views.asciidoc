= Creating New Views

The bare minimum needed when creating a new view is to define the `Route`, and to extend `Component` directly (*example 1*) or indirectly (*example 2*).

You can also extend `ViewFrame` to build a view with a header, scrollable content and footer (*example 3*). Most of the Business App Starter views are built with `ViewFrame`. They are located in the `com.vaadin.starter.business.ui.views` package.

== Example 1: Extending Component

If you extend `Component` directly, you must annotate the class with `@Tag`, e.g. `@Tag("div")`. For more information on how to use `Component` as a container, please see the link:https://vaadin.com/docs/v13/flow/creating-components/tutorial-component-container.html[Creating a Component Container].

[source,java]
----
@Route(value = <URL_fragment>, layout = MainLayout.class)
@Tag("div")
public class MyView extends Component {
  public MyView() {
    // Content goes here.
    getElement().appendChild(...);
  }
}
----

== Example 2: Extending Div
[source,java]
----
@Route(value = <URL_fragment>, layout = MainLayout.class)
public class MyView extends Div {
  public MyView() {
    // Content goes here.
    add(...);
  }
}
----


== Example 3: Extending ViewFrame
`setViewHeader`, `setViewContent` and `setViewFooter` all take a set of components, and puts them in their respective slot. All slots are optional.
[source,java]
----
@Route(value = <URL_fragment>, layout = MainLayout.class)
public class MyView extends ViewFrame {
  public MyView() {
    setViewHeader(Component... components);
    setViewContent(Component... components);
    setViewFooter(Component... components);
  }
}
----

== Please Remember
A few things to keep in mind when creating a new view:

* The URL fragment must be unique.
* The layout parameter defines the parent. Views are rendered inside their parent layout.

*The Business App Starter is built around `MainLayout.class`. Please use it as the default parent layout when creating new views.*

For information regarding routing in Vaadin, please see link:https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/routing/tutorial-routing-annotation.html[Routing and Navigation].

== Adding a View to the Sidebar
Once you’ve created your view, it’s time to add it to the `NaviDrawer` so that it can be accessed via the UI. Open up `MainLayout.java`, and go to the `initNaviItems` method.

This is where the navigation items are set up and added to the `NaviDrawer`. A navigation item consists of an icon, a title and a navigation target.

To add the view we created in the previous step, add the following line:
[source,java]
----
private void initNaviItems() {
  ...
  naviDrawer.addNaviItem(VaadinIcon.<ICON>, "My View", MyView.class);
  ...
}
----
