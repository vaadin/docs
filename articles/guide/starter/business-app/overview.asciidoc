== Structure
The Business App Starter's structure is comprised of several slots designed to help implement any layout.

=== Header & Footer Slots
These slots are intended for application-wide navigation, actions and branding. When using both the outer and inner elements, ensure the content hierarchy is clear and that they don't take up too much vertical space.

=== Navigation Slot
The navigation slot is reserved for the `NaviDrawer`: a responsive and collapsible navigation sidebar that houses searchable and hierarchical navigation items. It consists of a header intended for branding & account switching, a list of navigation items, and a footer which by default houses the collapse button.

==== Navigation Modes
The application supports two different navigation modes:

* *Traditional*: clicking a link changes the current view.
* *Tabbed*: a browser-esque experience where users can open and close tabs. Clicking a link changes the content of the current tab.

=== View Slot
The intended slot for views. Place views in this slot by setting the `@Route` annotation's `layout` parameter to `MainLayout.class`.

@Route(value = "my-view", layout = MainLayout.class)
@PageTitle("My View")
public class MyView extends ViewFrame {

==== ViewFrame & SplitViewFrame
All of the Business App Starter's views extend either `ViewFrame` or `SplitViewFrame`. They simplify the process of creating views that contain a header, (scrollable) content and footer. `SplitViewFrame` houses an additional details slot for creating master-detail views.

=== Layout Examples
Here are a few examples of common layouts used in business applications.

* Navigation drawer
* View with header

This layout puts more focus on the navigation drawer. Suitable for complex hierarchical navigation structures. The view footer houses view-specific actions.

Used slots:

* Navigation drawer
* Header (inner)
* View with footer

***

The navigation is placed in the outer header. The view area is maximised but the navigation has to be simple. The view's sidebar is used to display additional details.

Used slots:

* Header (outer)
* View with sidebar

== Custom Components

The Business App Starter comes with the following custom components:

* AppBar & TabBar
* Badge
* DetailsDrawer
* FlexBoxLayout
* ListItem
* NaviDrawer
* NaviTabs (closable)

=== AppBar & TabBar
`AppBar` consists of a main menu icon, contextual navigation icon, title, tabs, action items and avatar. All building blocks are optional.

`TabBar` is a simpler version of `AppBar` that discards the contextual navigation icon and title.

=== Badge

=== DetailsDrawer
Mainly intended for usage in master-detail views. Composed of a header, (scrollable) content and footer.

=== FlexBoxLayout
`FlexBoxLayout` is a server-side implementation of link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout[CSS Flexible Box Layout]. It extends `FlexLayout` and contains convenience methods for setting `flex`, `flex-basis`, `flex-direction`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-wrap`. It also supports setting `background-color`, `margin`, `overflow`, `padding`, `shadow`, `spacing` and `theme`.

=== ListItem
A list item comprised of a prefix, text (primary & secondary) and suffix. Only the primary text is mandatory. Any component can be placed in the prefix and suffix slots.
