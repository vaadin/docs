= Unit Testing in Flow

Every change in the code base requires a JUnit test for the code change.
In cases where a JUnit test is not plausible then an <<flow-integration-testing#,Integration Test>> should be added instead.

== Mocking
JUnit mocks use Mockito and other mocking libraries should not be used as they may break when there are version updates.
No new mocking libraries should be added to the project.

To help with tests there are many `Mock*` classes for use that make the setup for testing simpler.

== Conventions

JUnit tests should not leak settings and changes outside the test execution.
This means that any changes to current instances and system properties should be reset after the test execution.

Test method naming must follow the convention: {given}_{when}_{then}
