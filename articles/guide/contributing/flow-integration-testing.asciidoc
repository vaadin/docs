= Integration Testing in Flow

In addition to unit tests, we want to ensure that a given functionality works correctly in an application.
For this, we create View+IT combination.
The integration tests reside under link:https://github.com/vaadin/flow/tree/master/flow-tests[flow-tests] module in the flow code base.
Most of the integration tests for the core part are under `flow-test-core` module.
You find descriptions about what test modules there are link:https://github.com/vaadin/flow/blob/master/flow-tests/README.md[here].
