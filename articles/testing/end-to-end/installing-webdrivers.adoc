= Installing WebDrivers

Each browser requires a browser-specific WebDriver to be set up before tests can be run.

[TIP]
If you're creating a Maven project, consider using the automated WebDriver plugin. It automatically downloads the drivers you need. See https://github.com/vaadin/testbench-demo for an example.

If you want to install the drivers, most of them are available through the package manager (such as, `brew` or `apt-get`). You can also manually download and install the following drivers:

* GeckoDriver for Firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
* ChromeDriver for Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
* Microsoft web driver for Edge: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/

[TIP]
Safari drivers are pre-installed on Macs and don't need to be manually installed.

[NOTE]
The WebDriver version is often tied to the browser version. You need to make sure that the combination is a supported one. For example, ChromeDriver 2.35 only supports Chrome 62–64.

== Adding WebDriver to System Path

The driver executable must be included in the operating system `PATH` or be given to the test using a driver-specific system Java property:

* Google Chrome: `webdriver.chrome.driver`
* Mozilla Firefox: `webdriver.gecko.driver`
* Microsoft Edge: `webdriver.edge.driver`

Usually, it's simpler to add it to the `PATH` variable so that it's always available.
