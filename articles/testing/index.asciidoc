== Introduction

Testing Vaadin-based applications can be approached in two ways:

- browser-less testing
- browser-based testing

Each has its benefits and its issues, discussed in the following sections.

To perform browser-less testing, you can make use of either the specialized [classname]`UIUnitTest` class or Vaadin's Selenium-based TestBench testing tool.

For browser-based testing, the appropriate tool is TestBench.

== Browser-Less Unit Testing

Browser-less testing using [classname]`UIUnitTest` removes the necessity to run both the browser and the servlet container, to test your Vaadin-based applications faster.

Testing using [classname]`UIUnitTest` is *browser-less*, so you look up components straight from [methodname]`UI.getCurrent()`, bypassing the browser and the JavaScript->server bridge.
You call methods directly on your server-side view classes and on the server-side Java Vaadin components.

Testing using [classname]`UIUnitTest` is also *container-less*, so you do not need to launch the servlet container.
In this way, testing creates the Vaadin Session, the UI and other necessary Vaadin classes straight in the JVM that runs your JUnit tests.

An alternative approach is to use the TestBench testing tool.

Both approaches are described in the sections that follow.

== Browser-Based Testing

Vaadin TestBench is a tool that you can use to create and run *browser-based* integration tests for your Vaadin application.
TestBench simulates a user of your application, performs the tasks specified using Java code, and verifies that the expected actions take place in the application.

TestBench can also visually inspect your application and detect unintentionally introduced changes, and verify that the application is visually OK in all the browsers you are testing with.
TestBench also includes special support for other Vaadin products, making testing easy and robust compared to generic web testing solutions.
