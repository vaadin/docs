= Testing Vaadin Applications Using TestBench

:commercial-feature: TestBench
include::{articles}/_commercial-banner.asciidoc[opts=optional]

Vaadin-based applications are most easily tested using TestBench.
TestBench includes special support for other Vaadin products, making testing easy and robust compared to generic web testing solutions, such as Selenium.

TestBench testing can be approached in two ways:

- UI unit testing using the [classname]`UIUnitTest` class;
- end-to-end testing using the [classname]`TestBenchTestCase` class.

Each approach has its benefits and limitations, which are discussed in the <<{articles}/testing/unit-vs-e2e#,UI Unit vs. End-to-End Testing>> guide.
