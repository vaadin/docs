Vaadin-based applications are most easily tested using TestBench.
Testing can be approached in two ways:

- UI unit testing using the [classname]`UIUnitTest` class;
- end-to-end testing using the [classname]`TestBenchTestCase` class.

Each has its benefits and its issues, discussed in the following sections.

== End-to-End Testing

End-to-end testing using the [classname]`TestBenchTestCase` are a *browser-based* way to test your Vaadin applications.
An end-to-end tests simulates a user of your application, performs the tasks specified using Java code, and verifies that the expected actions take place in the application.

With end-to-end tests, you can also visually inspect your application and detect unintentionally introduced changes, and verify that the application is visually OK in all the browsers you are testing with.
TestBench also includes special support for other Vaadin products, making testing easy and robust compared to generic web testing solutions, such as Selenium.
