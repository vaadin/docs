:commercial-feature: TestBench
include::{articles}/_commercial-banner.asciidoc[opts=optional]

TestBench UI unit testing is *browser-less*, so you look up components straight from [methodname]`UI.getCurrent()`, bypassing the browser and the JavaScript -> server bridge. You call methods directly on your server-side view classes and on the server-side Java Vaadin components.

Because UI unit testing is also *container-less*, you don't need to launch the servlet container. The [classname]`UIUnitTest` class handles creating the Vaadin session, the UI and other necessary Vaadin classes right in the JVM that runs your JUnit tests.

In addition to UI unit testing, TestBench also enables you to write end-to-end tests for your Vaadin applications. <<../#comparison,Each approach has their own advantages>>.
