Vaadin TestBench is a tool for creating and running browser-based integration tests for your Vaadin application.
TestBench simulates a user of your application, performs the tasks specified using Java code, and verifies that the expected actions take place in the application.

TestBench can also visually inspect your application and detect unintentionally introduced changes, and verify that the application is visually OK in all the browsers you are testing with.
TestBench also includes special support for other Vaadin products, making testing easy and robust compared to generic web testing solutions.

Although it is not the main purpose of TestBench, you can also use TestBench to automate mundane tasks such as filling out forms.
