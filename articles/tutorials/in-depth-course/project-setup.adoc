= Hilla Project Setup

Make sure you have Java 11 and Maven installed before you begin.

This chapter covers:

* downloading a Hilla application starter
* importing a Hilla project in VS Code
* installing VS Code plugins for productive development
* running a Hilla application in development mode.

== Downloading a Hilla Application Starter

This tutorial uses a pre-configured starter from Hilla Start.
The starter application includes:

* a data model consisting of [classname]#Contact#, [classname]#Company#, and [classname]#Status# JPA entities;
* Spring Data repositories for persisting and retrieving the entities from an embedded H2 database;
* a data generator that populates the database with test data;
* a single, empty view;
* a Dockerfile.

Create an application using the Vaadin CLI:

[source,terminal]
----
npx @vaadin/cli init --preset hilla-crm-tutorial hilla-crm
----

== Importing a Hilla project in VS Code

Open the created `hilla-crm` folder in VS Code.
You can open the folder by:

* navigating to the project folder and running `code .` (note the period), or
* choosing **File > Open (Folder)...** in VS Code and selecting the _project folder_.

== Installing VS Code Plugins for Productive Development

When you import the project, VS Code should show a prompt suggesting recommended plugins.
Select **Install**.

If you do not see the prompt, install the following plugins manually through the **Extensions** view.

== Hilla Project Structure

Now that you have the project imported, it is time to get familiar with the structure.

The two main folders to be aware of are:

* `frontend` - this is where your views and frontend code live.
* `src` - this is where your Java backend code lives.

The key files in a Hilla application are:

* [filename]#pom.xml# - the project configuration file, which defines backend dependencies
* [filename]#frontend/index.html# - the bootstrap page
* [filename]#frontend/index.ts# - the routing definition
* [filename]#src/main/java/com/example/application/Application.java# - runs the Spring Boot application.

== Running a Hilla Application in Development Mode

Start the application by locating [filename]#Application.java# within the `src` folder, right-clicking on it and selecting *Run*.
You can also select *Debug* if you wish to debug the server endpoint code.

You can also run the application from the command line with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
./mvnw
----

The first startup may take a few minutes.
Hilla downloads all the needed frontend and backend dependencies and builds the application.
Hilla also installs Node and `npm`, if you do not already have them installed on your computer.

When the build finishes, Hilla opens your default browser at http://localhost:8080.

Hilla reloads your browser automatically when you make changes during development.
Try this out by modifying the placeholder content in the [methodname]#render()# method in [filename]#frontend/views/list/list-view.ts# and saving the file.
Your browser should reflect the change within a second or two.

.`list-view.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
render() {
  return html`<h1>Hello, world!</h1>`;
}
