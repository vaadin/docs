= Deploying Using a Servlet Container

Deploying a Hilla application to traditional servlet containers, such as Tomcat, Jetty or any Java/Jakarta EE server, is really no different from other web applications. You'll need to ensure you use the production profile in your build to get optimal performance.

Follow the official documentation of your servlet container for best practices for production deployment.

[Note]
If you're using the Spring Boot starter, it first needs to be converted to a `WAR` file packaging.


== Embedded Servlet Containers

As is done by default in Spring Boot applications, many servlet containers can be embedded in your application and so be packaged as executable `JAR` files. Follow examples from your favorite Servlet container.
