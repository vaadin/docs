= Deploying to Production

// TODO I hear this is outdated

// Although you may have launched your server directly from your IDE during development, for production you need to deploy the application as a `WAR` file (Java Servlet) or `JAR` file that includes your application server (Spring Boot and other embedded servers).

// The main difference between development and production modes is that, in the development mode, Hilla uses `webpack` to serve JavaScript files to the browser, instead of the Java server the application is running on.
// This is so that if you change a JavaScript or CSS file, your changes are picked up and served automatically.
// When you are in production mode, you don't want this extra overhead, since the files will not change.
// It's more efficient to prepare JavaScript and CSS files once, during build, and let one server (the Java Server) serve all requests.
// At the same time, the client resources can be optimized and minified to reduce the load on the network and browser even further.
