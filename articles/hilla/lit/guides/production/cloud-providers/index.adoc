= Deploying Using Cloud Providers

Hilla applications are standard Java Web Applications, and as such can be deployed on most cloud services that support Java applications.

Some providers require a pre-built `JAR` or `WAR` file, while others allow you to deploy, for example, directly from GitHub.
For this reason, the documentation is split up into articles that each cover an individual cloud provider.

Even though deployment itself varies from provider to provider, you should read the <<../production-build#, Production Build>> article before delving into the tutorials, as this explains some common topics, such as what a production build is and how to do such a build.
