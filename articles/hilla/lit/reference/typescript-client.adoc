= TypeScript Client Library

Hilla consists of two parts: a backend and a client.
The client part is represented by the `@vaadin/hilla-core` library, which is able to support the features the backend provides.

One of the main public entities of the library is the [classname]`ConnectClient` object, which provides a seamless way to communicate with Hilla endpoints on the backend.

== Default TypeScript Client

The default TypeScript client is the module that gets generated by the Hilla Maven plugin for a particular project.

The module contains the [classname]`ConnectClient` implementation, which is set up to communicate with the backend of the project.

== Generated Client Modules

Along with the default TypeScript client, the Hilla Maven plugin is capable of generating specific modules for each Hilla endpoint defined in the backend.
These modules also use the default TypeScript client described above to communicate with the backend.

== Usage Example

Consider a Hilla backend that's started on the `/customEndpoint` endpoint and has a single endpoint with the name [classname]`SingleEndpoint` and a method [methodname]`customMethod()` that takes a parameter `number`.

To access this method from the client part, depending on how many generated files are present, you can use one of the following approaches.
The required `@vaadin/hilla-core` TypeScript library is automatically installed by the Hilla Maven plugin.

=== Using the Generated Client Module

The endpoint method can be called via the generated module method:

.Using the generated module
[source,typescript]
[[generated-module]]
----
import { SingleEndpoint } from 'Frontend/generated/SingleEndpoint';

(async() => {
  await SingleEndpoint.customMethod(4);
})();
----

=== Using the Generated Default Client

As an alternative to the generated module, the default TypeScript client API can be used to access the Hilla endpoint as follows:

.Using the generated client
[source,typescript]
[[generated-client]]
----
import client from 'Frontend/generated/connect-client.default';

(async() => {
  await client.call('SingleEndpoint', 'customMethod', {number: 4});
});
----

=== Using the Hilla TypeScript Client Library

Using the client library requires an extra step where we specify the endpoint of the server to send the requests to:

.Using the client library
[source,typescript]
[[client-library]]
----
import { ConnectClient } from '@vaadin/hilla-core';
const client = new ConnectClient({endpoint: '/customEndpoint'});

(async() => {
  await client.call('SingleEndpoint', 'customMethod', {number: 4});
});
