SSO Kit provides all that's needed to add single sign-on capabilities to your Hilla applications, based on https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect].

The following identity providers are supported:

- https://www.okta.com/[Okta]
- https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak]
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory/[Azure Active Directory]

SSO Kit is compatible with Hilla, starting with version https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/releases/tag/2.0.0[2.0.0]. It requires at least one OpenID Connect client, though, configured on an instance from one of the providers listed here.
