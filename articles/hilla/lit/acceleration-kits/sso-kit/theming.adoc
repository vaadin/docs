Each SSO provider has its own way of customizing the log-in page, with different features and limitations. This page explains how to customize the log-in screen for authentication providers.


== Keycloak

Keycloak is the most customizable of authentication providers, from the login page to the administration and user dashboards.

SSO Kit offers a custom theme for Keycloak based on https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/styling/lumo[Lumo]. It gives the provider's login page a look-and-feel similar to what a Hilla developer would experience using the https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/components/login[Login component].


=== Installation

To use the Keycloak Lumo theme, first download the http://tools.vaadin.com/nexus/content/repositories/vaadin-prereleases/com/vaadin/sso-kit-keycloak-theme/[`sso-kit-keycloak-lumo`] JAR file from Maven.

Next, copy the JAR file into the [filename]`/providers` directory of your Keycloak installation.

Once you've done those two steps, you can either set the theme for all or some clients in a realm. To set the theme for all clients, go to _Realm Settings_ &rarr; _Themes_. At the _Login Theme_ selector, choose `sso-kit-keycloak-lumo`. 

To set the theme for a specific client, go to _Clients_ and find that client. At the _Login Settings_ section, select `sso-kit-keycloak-lumo` as the _Login Theme_.


=== Customize the Lumo Theme

You can also customize the Lumo theme to suit your application's branding. To do this, you need to do a few things: create a directory structure; define some particular properties; and configure CSS. Each of these is described next with examples.

The first step is to create the directory structure, illustrated here, under the [filename]`/themes` directory of your Keycloak installation:

----
themes/
└── your-theme/
    ├── resources/css/
    │  └── my-theme-styles.css
    └── themes.properties
----

In [filename]`themes.properties`, you have to define some properties such as the parent theme, and load the CSS files:

.themes.properties
[source,properties]
----
# Specify the parent theme:
parent=sso-kit-keycloak-lumo
# Load the parent theme files:
styles=css/lumo-common.css css/lumo-styles.css css/my-theme-styles.css
----

Next, in [filename]`my-theme-styles.css` you can add your styles. For example, you might change the primary color to suit your application's branding. That could look like this:

.`my-theme-styles.css`
[source,css]
----
html {
  --lumo-primary-color: rgb(22, 138, 72);
  --lumo-primary-color-50pct: rgba(22, 138, 72, 0.704);
}
----

While working on a custom theme, you might want to disable Keycloak theme caching. You would do that like this:

[.example]
--
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
./bin/kc.bat start-dev --spi-theme-static-max-age=-1 --spi-theme-cache-themes=false --spi-theme-cache-templates=false
----
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="macOS/Linux"></source-info>
./bin/kc.sh start-dev --spi-theme-static-max-age=-1 --spi-theme-cache-themes=false --spi-theme-cache-templates=false
----
