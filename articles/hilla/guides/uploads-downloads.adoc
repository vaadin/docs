= Uploading & Downloading Files

Transferring files between the client and server is a common requirement in web applications. This page demonstrates how to implement file uploading and downloading in Hilla React applications.


[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.7"]
== Uploading Files

Hilla supports the https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/multipart/MultipartFile.html[MultipartFile] class from Spring to handle file uploads. It maps to the standard https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File[File] interface in the generated TypeScript code.

The following example demonstrates how to implement such a service and connect it to the <</components/upload#,Upload>> component in a view:

[.example]
--
[source,tsx]
.`upload.tsx`
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/forms/upload/upload.tsx[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
[source,java]
.`UploadService.java`
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/upload/UploadService.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]

== Downloading Files

Hilla endpoints only respond to `POST` requests and don't support file downloads. Since Hilla applications use Spring, though, you can leverage Spring's capabilities to implement file downloading.

Select the server mapping that best suits your application. Then create an ad-hoc endpoint to handle file downloads.

Next, configure security using the usual Spring Security configuration semantics.

In the following example, the view downloads a file and passes an ID as a parameter. The endpoint generates the file and sends it to the client. The security is configured so that only authenticated users can download files.

[source,tsx]
.`download.tsx`

include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/forms/upload/download.tsx[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
[source,java]
.`FileDownloadEndpoint.java`
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/download/FileDownloadEndpoint.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
[source,java]
.`SecurityConfig.java`
