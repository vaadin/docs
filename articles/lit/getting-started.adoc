== Creating a new Hilla project

You can create a new Hilla project using the Vaadin CLI:

[source,terminal]
----
npx @vaadin/cli init --hilla my-hilla-app
----

You can also create a project with the basic <<security/configuring#, security configuration>> added to it using the `--auth` option:

[source,terminal]
----
npx @vaadin/cli init --hilla --auth hilla-with-auth
----

== Running a Hilla project

Change into the newly created directory and run the application with the included Maven wrapper.
This runs both the front-end and back-end build, and opens your web browser to localhost:8080.

[source,terminal]
----
cd my-hilla-app
./mvnw
----
