= Role-Based Access Control for Views

// TODO I assume the --auth CLI parameter would be the natural starting point for this, instead of pointing to the full-blown article/tutorial
To follow the examples in this article, you need a Hilla application with authentication enabled.
Follow <<spring-login#, Authentication With Spring Security>> to get started.

== Define Roles with Spring Security

Roles are a set of string attributes representing the authorities that are assigned to a user.

In Spring Security, the user details used for authentication also specify roles.
Typically, roles are defined in authority strings prefixed with `ROLE_`.
After successful authentication, these are accessible via the [classname]`GrantedAuthority` objects returned by [methodname]`Authentication.getAuthorities()`.
See <<spring-login#, Authentication With Spring Security>> for examples of configuration.

== Using Roles in TypeScript

A convenient way to use roles for access control in TypeScript views is to add a Hilla endpoint that gets user information, including roles, from Java during authentication.

First, define a bean representing information about the user:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/security/authentication/UserInfo.java[tags=snippet]
----

Next, add the endpoint to get a [classname]`UserInfo` containing authorities for the logged-in user on the client side:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/security/authentication/UserInfoEndpoint.java[tags=snippet]
----

Then, change the authentication implementation in TypeScript to get the user information from the endpoint.
Change the [filename]`auth.ts` defined in <<spring-login#client-configuration, Authentication With Spring Security>> as follows:

.`auth.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/authentication/auth.ts[tags=basic;login;userinfo;!offline]
----

Add a [methodname]`isUserInRole()` helper, which enables role-based access control checks for the UI.

.`auth.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/authentication/auth.ts[tags=isUserInRole]
----

== Routes with Access Control

To enable allowed roles to be specified on the view routes, define an extended type [classname]`ViewRoute` that has a `rolesAllowed` string, as follows:

.`routes.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/authentication/routes.ts[tags=ViewRoute]
----

Add a method to check access for the given route by iterating `rolesAllowed` using [methodname]`isUserInRole()`, as follows:

.`routes.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/authentication/routes.ts[tags=isAuthorizedViewRoute]
----

Then use the method added in the route action to redirect on unauthorized access, as follows:

.`routes.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/authentication/routes.ts[tags=routes]
----

== Hiding Unauthorized Menu Items

Filter the route list using the [methodname]`isAuthorizedViewRoute()` helper defined earlier.
Then use the filtered list of routes as menu items:

.`main-view.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/authentication/main-view.ts[tags=menuRoutes]
----

// end::content[]
