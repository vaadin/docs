= Hilla guides

// Hilla is an application framework in which you write client-side code with TypeScript.
// Hilla views connect with server-side Java endpoints that can provide business data and logic, and can connect further with back-end services.

// This chapter gives a more thorough and practical overview of Hilla application basics.
// The various topics in this chapter are described in more detail in the further documentation.

// == Hilla Application Architecture

// The basic elements of an application built with Hilla are:

// Application Shell::
// The [filename]`index.html` file that's loaded first sets up application styles and loads the application scripts.
// The main entry point is an [filename]`index.ts` script, where you set up routes to display the various views of the application, and do any other initialization needed by the application.

// Views::
// The user interface of an application consists of one or more views.
// Views are built from Hilla web components by extending the [classname]`LitElement` component.
// Each view can display different data or other functionalities.
// Typically, you have at least a main view, and possibly a login view to enter that.
// A main view typically contains child views that fit inside the layout of the main view.
// Such child views could be "Products", "Personnel", or "Tasks".
// +
// As a view in Hilla is a web component that extends [classname]`LitElement`, it's an HTML element.
// The views are defined declaratively in a reactive manner, where changes in a view's state cause it to be redrawn to reflect the new data.

// Binding views to data::
//   Views typically display some data or allow the user to enter some.
