= Upgrading from Hilla 1.x

To migrate a Hilla 1.x application to Hilla 2.0, you'll have to change several things in your application. Many of the breaking changes in Hilla 2 were introduced by the following updates of the underlying Java platform dependencies:

*Jakarta EE 10 & Servlet 6*::
Hilla 2 is based on Servlet 6 specifications and is compatible with the Jakarta EE 10. Changing from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` is required for validation and some nullability annotations in Java.

*Spring Boot 3*::
Hilla 2 uses the latest Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6 versions. This leads in turn to making breaking changes in Spring-based features compared to earlier Spring-boot 2 and Spring Framework 5 versions.

*Java 17*::
Hilla 2 requires Java 17 or later. This is dictated by Spring framework and newer versions of application servers.

Aside from these changes in Hilla dependencies, here are the notable changes in the framework itself:

*Multi-Module Endpoints Parser & Generator*::
Hilla 2 changes the parser and generator that are used to produce TypeScript code for endpoints. As a result, some adjustments to Java endpoints and entities code in Hilla applications might be required. The `hillaEngine` experimental feature flag was removed.

*Reactive Endpoints*::
Released previously as an experimental feature behind the `hillaPush` feature flag, reactive endpoints are now enabled by default.

*Vaadin Components 24*::
Hilla 2 complements Vaadin Flow 24 release. The Vaadin components, introduced in version 24, support styling using the `::part()` CSS selector. They come with some changes that affect styling the component internals.


== Preparation

Before migrating any application, a few tasks must be done. They're described in the sub-sections here.


=== Set Up Node.js

Installing an up-to-date version of Node.js 18 is recommended before starting with Hilla 2 migration. For an optimal and smooth application development experience, make sure to have `node` executables in the `PATH` environment variable. Follow the link:https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/[Node.js installation instructions].


=== Maven Wrapper

Hilla 2 requires either a Maven wrapper script in the application, or the `mvn` executable in the environment, for configuring the endpoints parser and generator from the settings declared `pom.xml`.

If your project has `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` Maven wrapper scripts, Hilla 2 uses it to install and run Maven. The link:https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/[Maven Wrapper] website offers download links and instructions for installing it in a project.

For installing Maven in your system environment, see the link:https://maven.apache.org/install.html[Installing Apache Maven] documentation page.


=== Hilla Dependency Upgrade

Upgrade the Hilla version in the [filename]`pom.xml` file to the latest release like so:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<hilla.version>2.0.0</hilla.version>
----

You can find the latest version number in the link:https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/releases[GitHub Hilla releases list].


== Jakarta EE 10 Namespaces

You can find on GitHub a couple of free tools for the package name conversion: https://github.com/eclipse/transformer[Eclipse Transformer]; and https://github.com/apache/tomcat-jakartaee-migration[Apache Migration Tool].

When applied to a project, these tools convert when needed Java class imports, manifests, property files, and other resources to use `jakarta.*` namespace. Conversion instructions can be found in each tool's [filename]`README` file.

The last versions of IntelliJ IDEA offers https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2022.2/migrate.html[migration refactoring] tools, including a Java EE to Jakarta EE package converter.

Make sure the Jakarta specifications in your project have the proper versions. Refer to the full list of https://jakarta.ee/release/10/[Jakarta EE 10 specifications] for more information.

Below are some examples:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.annotation</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.annotation-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.enterprise</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.enterprise.cdi-api</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.enterprise.concurrent</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.enterprise.concurrent-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----


== Spring Upgrade Instructions

Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6 don't fundamentally change how applications are developed. The main changes are around Jakarta EE 10 namespaces and supported products, Java version, and the dependency upgrades and deprecations.

Spring Boot 3 and Framework 6 use new versions of third-party dependencies: Hibernate 6, Hibernate Validator 8, servlet containers -- Jetty 11, Tomcat 10.1 and many others.

Spring provides the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Migration-Guide[Dedicated Migration Guide for Spring-boot 3.0] and the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Upgrading-to-Spring-Framework-6.x[Upgrading to Spring Framework 6.x Guide].

To browse the full list of changes, see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Release-Notes[Spring-boot 3.0 Release Notes] and the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/What%27s-New-in-Spring-Framework-6.x[What's New in Spring Framework 6.x] page.

Below is a general overview of the changes needed for Spring-based Vaadin applications:

=== Upgrade Spring to Latest

You'll need to upgrade Spring versions to the latest, including the starter parent dependency:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.2</version>
</parent>
----

=== Deprecation*

Deprecated `VaadinWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` was removed since Spring no longer has the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` class. Use instead the `VaadinWebSecurity` base class for your security configuration. Below is an example of this:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/articles/lit/guides/security/SecurityConfig.java[tags="stateless-configure"]
----

In this example, `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` -- used in Spring Boot 2.x -- is replaced by `UserDetailsService`. And `http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers()` are replaced by `http.authorizeHttpRequests().requestMatchers()`.


== Java Version

Java 17 or later is required. Below is an example of how to use this version:

[.example]
--
[source,xml]
----
<source-info group="Maven"></source-info>
<properties>
    <java.version>17</java.version>
    <!-- OR: -->
    <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
----
--


== Maven Plugins

Several plugins are available for use with Maven. Those that are relevant to upgrading a Hilla application to Hilla 2.0 are described here.


=== Hilla Maven Plugin

Starting from Vaadin 24, `vaadin-maven-plugin` alone doesn't support generating Hilla endpoints. Replace it with `hilla-maven-plugin` to enable using Hilla endpoints:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<groupId>dev.hilla</groupId>
<artifactId>hilla-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<version>${hilla.version}</version>
----

You can use Maven goals of the former `vaadin-maven-plugin` the same way from the `hilla-maven-plugin`. This primarily affects hybrid applications, which have both Hilla client-side and Flow server-side views, and were created with Vaadin / Fusion 23 or earlier.


=== Third-Party Plugin Versions

Make sure that the versions of Maven plugins -- the ones defined explicitly in your project -- are compatible with Java 17. For example, `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` requires a minimal version 1.6.13.


== SLF4J 2.0

Hilla 2, Vaadin 24 and Spring Boot 3 use SLF4J library version 2.0, which has breaking changes compared to earlier versions. See the https://www.slf4j.org/news.html[SLF4J release notes] for more information.


== Changes in Hilla Endpoints

The behavior of null type annotations, such as `@dev.hilla.Nonnull`, has been fixed according to the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7.4[Java Language Specification]. In particular, this affects arrays in endpoints and entity classes:

- `@dev.hilla.Nonnull String[]` is a nullable array type whose items are non-null.
- `String @dev.hilla.Nonnull []` is a non-null array type whose items are nullable.
- `@dev.hilla.Nonnull String @dev.hilla.Nonnull []` is a non-null array type whose items are non-null.

This also affects nullability in generated TypeScript code. Consider using the link:https://hilla.dev/docs/lit/reference/type-nullability/#nonnullapi[@NonNullApi] annotation for declaring nullability on the package level.


== Breaking Changes in Vaadin Components

Upgrading a Hilla application to Hilla 2 can involve several breaking changes. They're described in the following sub-sections.

=== Behavior & Styling

Upgrading can lead to changes in the behavior and styling. Below is a list of these changes and what you might do to resolve problems they may cause:

- Badges no longer shrink by default. This can be overridden with CSS `[theme~="badge"] { flex-shrink:1; }`.
- Buttons no longer shrink by default. This can be overridden with CSS `vaadin-button { flex-shrink:1; }`.
- Number Field's default width now matches that of other text input components. You can restore the old default back with CSS `vaadin-number-field { width:8em; }`.
- Time Picker no longer automatically adjusts values to fit min/max constraints.
- The default top and bottom margins of the `H1`...`H6` HTML elements have been removed. This change can be reverted by applying the following CSS:
+
.styles.css
[source,css]
----
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 { margin-top: 1.25em; }
h1 { margin-bottom: 0.75em; }
h2, h3, h4 { margin-bottom: 0.5em; }
h5 { margin-bottom: 0.25em; }
----


=== API of Web Components

The following changes affect the client-side APIs of Vaadin components:

- The label on `vaadin-checkbox` and `vaadin-radio-button` must be assigned using the `label` property since the default slot has been removed.
- `vaadin-confirm-dialog.cancel` and `.reject` properties were renamed to `.cancelButtonVisible` and `.rejectButtonVisible`.
- `vaadin-number-field` property `has-controls` was renamed `step-buttons-visible`.
- Deprecated `@vaadin/vaadin-**` (e.g., `@vaadin/vaadin-grid`) npm packages have been removed. Use instead the new `@vaadin/**` (i.e., `@vaadin/grid`).
- Deprecated `**Element` legacy class aliases (e.g., `GridElement`) have been removed. Use instead the plain component classes (i.e., `Grid`).
- Deprecated misspelled `vaadin-icons` were removed: `buss`, `funcion`, `megafone`, `palete`, and `trendind-down`.
- `notifyResize` and `updateStyles` methods were removed from various components as obsolete.
- `preventInvalidInput` in text input fields were removed in favor of `setAllowedCharPattern`.
- The read-only `theme` _property_ was removed. Use instead the `theme` _attribute_.
