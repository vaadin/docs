= Upgrading from Hilla 1

This article describes changes required for a Hilla 1.x application to migrate it to Hilla 2.0.

== Overview

Many of the breaking changes in Hilla 2 are introduced by the following updates of the underlying Java platform dependencies:

*Jakarta EE 10 and Servlet 6*::
Hilla 2 is based on Servlet 6 specifications and is compatible with the Jakarta EE 10. Changing from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` is required for validation and some nullability annotations in Java.

*Spring Boot 3*::
Hilla 2 uses the latest Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6 versions. This leads in turn to making breaking changes in Spring-based features compared to earlier Spring-boot 2 and Spring Framework 5 versions.

*Java 17*::
Hilla 2 requires Java 17 or later. This is dictated by Spring framework and newer versions of application servers.

Aside from these changes in Hilla dependencies, here are the notable changes in the framework itself:

*Multi-module endpoints parser and generator*::
Hilla 2 changes the parser and generator that are used to produce TypeScript code for endpoints. As a result, some adjustments to Java endpoints and entities code in Hilla applications might be required. The `hillaEngine` experimental feature flag was removed.

*Reactive endpoints*::
Released before as an experimental feature behind the `hillaPush` feature flag, reactive endpoints are now enabled by default.

*Vaadin components 24*::
Hilla 2 complements Vaadin 24 release. Vaadin components version 24 introduces support of styling using the `::part()` CSS selector, which comes with some changes affecting styling the component internals.


== Preparations

=== Setting up Node.js

Installing an up-to-date version of Node.js 18 is recommended before starting with Hilla 2 migration. For the optimal and smooth application development experience, make sure to have `node` executables in the `PATH` environment variable. Here are the link:https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/[Node.js installation] instructions to follow.

=== Maven wrapper

Hilla 2 requires either a Maven wrapper script in the application, or the `mvn` executable in the environment for configuring the endpoints parser and generator from the settings declared `pom.xml`.

If your project has `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` Maven wrapper scripts, Hilla 2 uses it to install and run Maven. The link:https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/[Maven Wrapper] website offers download links and instructions for installing it in a project.

For installing Maven in your system environment, see the link:https://maven.apache.org/install.html[Installing Apache Maven] page.

=== Hilla dependency upgrade

Upgrade the Hilla version in `pom.xml` to the latest release:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<hilla.version>2.0.0</hilla.version>
----

Find the latest version number using the link:https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/releases[GitHub Hilla releases list].


== Jakarta EE 10 namespaces

You can use the following free tools for the package name conversion:

* https://github.com/eclipse/transformer[Eclipse transformer]
* https://github.com/apache/tomcat-jakartaee-migration[Apache migration tool]

When being applied to a project, those tools convert Java class imports, manifests, property files, and other resources to use `jakarta.*` namespace when needed. Conversion instructions are in each tool's `README` file.

The last versions of IntelliJ IDEA offers https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2022.2/migrate.html[migration refactoring] tools, including a Java EE to Jakarta EE package converter.

Make sure that the Jakarta specifications in your project have the proper versions. Refer to the full list of https://jakarta.ee/release/10/[Jakarta EE 10 specifications] for more information.

Below are a some examples:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.annotation</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.annotation-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.enterprise</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.enterprise.cdi-api</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.enterprise.concurrent</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.enterprise.concurrent-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----


== Spring upgrade instructions

Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6 don't fundamentally change how applications are developed. The main changes are around Jakarta EE 10 namespaces and supported products, Java version and the dependency upgrades and deprecations.

Spring Boot 3 / Framework 6 use new versions of third-party dependencies: Hibernate 6, Hibernate Validator 8, servlet containers - Jetty 11, Tomcat 10.1 and many others.

Spring provides the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Migration-Guide[Dedicated Migration Guide for Spring-boot 3.0] and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Upgrading-to-Spring-Framework-6.x[Upgrading to Spring Framework 6.x Guide].

To browse the full list of changes, see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Release-Notes[Spring-boot 3.0 Release Notes] and the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/What%27s-New-in-Spring-Framework-6.x[What's New in Spring Framework 6.x] page.

Below is a general overview of the changes needed for Spring-based Vaadin applications:

* *Upgrade Spring to the Latest*
+
You need to upgrade Spring versions to the latest, including the starter parent dependency:
+
.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.2</version>
</parent>
----

* *Deprecation*
+
Deprecated `VaadinWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` was removed since Spring no longer has `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` class. Use instead `VaadinWebSecurity` base class for your security configuration. Below is an example of this:
+
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/security/stateless/SecurityConfig.java[tags="stateless-configure"]
----
+
In this example, `AuthenticationManagerBuilder`, used in Spring-boot 2.x, is replaced by `UserDetailsService`. And `http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers()` are replaced by `http.authorizeHttpRequests().requestMatchers()`.


== Java version

*Java 17* or later is required. Below is an example of how to use this version:

[.example]
--
[source,xml]
----
<source-info group="Maven"></source-info>
<properties>
    <java.version>17</java.version>
    <!-- OR: -->
    <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
----
--


== Maven plugins

=== Hilla Maven plugin

Starting from Vaadin 24, `vaadin-maven-plugin` alone does not support generating Hilla endpoints. Replace it with `hilla-maven-plugin` to enable using Hilla endpoint:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<groupId>dev.hilla</groupId>
<artifactId>hilla-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<version>${hilla.version}</version>
----

You can use Maven goals of the former `vaadin-maven-plugin` the same way from the `hilla-maven-plugin`.

This primarily affects hybrid applications, which have both Hilla client-side and Flow server-side views, and were created with Vaadin / Fusion 23 or earlier.

=== Third-party plugin versions

Make sure that the versions of Maven plugins your project defines explicitly, are compatible with Java 17.

As an example, `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` requires a minimal version 1.6.13.


== SLF4J 2.0

Hilla 2, Vaadin 24 and Spring Boot 3 use SLF4J library version 2.0, which has breaking changes compared to earlier versions. See the https://www.slf4j.org/news.html[SLF4J release notes] for more information.


== Changes in Hilla endpoints

The behavior of null type annotations, such as `@dev.hilla.Nonnull`, has been fixed according to the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7.4[Java Language Specification]. In particular, it means that for arrays in endpoints and entity classes is:

- `@dev.hilla.Nonnull String[]` is a nullable array type whose items are non-null;
- `String @dev.hilla.Nonnull []` is non-null array type whose items are nullable;
- `@dev.hilla.Nonnull String @dev.hilla.Nonnull []` is a non-null array type whose items are non-null.

This affects nullability in generated TypeScript code.

Consider using the link:https://hilla.dev/docs/lit/reference/type-nullability/#nonnullapi[@NonNullApi] annotation for declaring nullability on the package level.


== Breaking changes in Vaadin components

=== Changes in behavior and styling

* Badges no longer shrink by default; this can be overridden with CSS `[theme~="badge"] { flex-shrink:1; }`
* Buttons no longer shrink by default; this can be overridden with CSS `vaadin-button { flex-shrink:1; }`
* Number Field's default width now matches that of other text input components; you can bring the old default back with CSS `vaadin-number-field { width:8em; }`
* Time Picker no longer automatically adjusts values to fit min/max constraints
* The default top and bottom margins of the `H1`...`H6` HTML elements have been removed; this change can be reverted by applying the following CSS:
+
.styles.css
[source,css]
----
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 { margin-top: 1.25em; }
h1 { margin-bottom: 0.75em; }
h2, h3, h4 { margin-bottom: 0.5em; }
h5 { margin-bottom: 0.25em; }
----

=== Changes in the API of web components

The following changes affect the client-side APIs of Vaadin components:

// Concise examples in parentheses seem to fit well in this list
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Parens = NO -->]

* The label on `vaadin-checkbox` and `vaadin-radio-button` must be assigned using the `label` property, as the default slot has been removed
* `vaadin-confirm-dialog.cancel` and `.reject` properties renamed `.cancelButtonVisible` and `.rejectButtonVisible`
* `vaadin-number-field` property `has-controls` renamed `step-buttons-visible`
* Deprecated `@vaadin/vaadin-**` (for example, `@vaadin/vaadin-grid`) npm packages have been removed; use the new `@vaadin/**` instead (`@vaadin/grid`)
* Deprecated `**Element` legacy class aliases (for example, `GridElement`) have been removed; use the plain component classes instead (`Grid`)
* Deprecated misspelled `vaadin-icons` removed: `buss`, `funcion`, `megafone`, `palete`, `trendind-down`
* `notifyResize` and `updateStyles` methods removed from various components as obsolete
* `preventInvalidInput` in text input fields removed in favor of `setAllowedCharPattern`
* The read-only `theme` _property_ was removed; use the `theme` _attribute_ instead

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Parens = YES -->]
