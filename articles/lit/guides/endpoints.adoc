= Endpoints for Accessing Java Backend

An _endpoint_ in Hilla is a class that defines one or more public methods, and is annotated with the `@Endpoint` annotation.

Hilla bridges Java backend endpoints and a TypeScript frontend. It generates TypeScript clients to call the Java backend in a type-checkable way. The <<../reference/endpoint-generator#,Endpoint generator>> reference page contains details about the generator itself.

.Hilla endpoints depend on Spring Boot auto-configuration.
[IMPORTANT]
Hilla endpoints don't work if auto-configuration is disabled, such as when you use `@EnableWebMvc`. As a workaround, remove the `@EnableWebMvc` annotation, as described in the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.3.4.RELEASE/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-spring-mvc-auto-configuration[Spring Boot documentation]. If you have a suggestion as to how to make it more useful, please share your idea on link:https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/issues/new/[GitHub].


[[creating]]
== Creating an Endpoint

An endpoint is a Java class annotated with `@Endpoint`:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/accessingbackend/CounterEndpoint.java[tags=snippet]
----

When the application starts, Hilla scans the classpath for `@Endpoint`-annotated classes. For each request to access a public method in a Hilla endpoint, a permission check is carried out. `@AnonymousAllowed` means that Hilla permits anyone to call the method from the client side.

Refer to the <<security#, Security>> article for details of configuring endpoint access.


[[browser-callable]]
[role="since:dev.hilla:hilla@v2.2"]
=== `@BrowserCallable` Alias

Since Hilla 2.2, an additional annotation, `@BrowserCallable` has been added as an alias for `@Endpoint`. Similar to `@Endpoint`, this annotation is also intended to be used for publishing services to call them from the browser in a type-safe manner.

Use `@BrowserCallable` if the name _'Endpoint'_ creates confusion with the so-called _REST Endpoints_, and when you don't need to change the endpoint name.

.Example Using `@BrowserCallable` Instead of `@Endpoint`:
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/accessingbackend/CounterService.java[tags=snippet]
----

The only difference is that `@BrowserCallable` doesn't support the `value` attribute. This means the endpoint name is always the same as the class name.


== Modules Generated from Hilla Endpoints

Hilla generates a TypeScript module for every Hilla endpoint on the backend. Each such module exports all of the methods in the endpoint.

You can import an entire module from the https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/barrel[barrel] file, import all methods as a module from the endpoint file, or select individual endpoint methods. For example, the [filename]`CounterEndpoint.ts` could be used as in the following snippets:

.`index.ts` (import the whole endpoint module object from the barrel file)
[[index.ts]]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/application/accessing-backend/ts-imports/barrel.ts[]
----

[NOTE]
The barrel file exports all of the endpoints at once. Therefore, you can import multiple endpoints using a single import.

.`index.ts` (import all imports as an endpoint object)
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/application/accessing-backend/ts-imports/asterisk.ts[]
----

.`index.ts` (import a single endpoint method)
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/application/accessing-backend/ts-imports/method.ts[]
----

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Terms-FrontendBackend = NO -->]

.Frontend Directory Alias
[NOTE]
====
The `'Frontend/'` path prefix is an alias for the `{project.basedir}/frontend` directory in your application project.

Hilla has this path alias in <<../reference/configuration#ts-compiler-options,the default TypeScript compiler configuration>> ([filename]`tsconfig.json`); the Vite configuration file ([filename]`vite.generated.js`) respects the `tsconfig` aliases by default.

Using this path alias is recommended since it allows for absolute import paths, rather than traversing the directory hierarchy in relative imports.
====

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Terms-FrontendBackend = YES -->]

Hilla generates the TypeScript modules automatically when you compile the application, as well as when the application is running in development mode.

By default, the generated files are located under `{project.basedir}/frontend/generated`. You can change the folder by providing the path for the generator in the `generatedFrontendDirectory` property for the Hilla Maven plugin.

Hilla handles conversion between Java and TypeScript types. For more information about supported types, see <<../reference/type-conversion#, Type conversion>>.


== TypeScript Module Content Example

The generated TypeScript module for the Java endpoint defined in <<creating,`CounterEndpoint.java`>>, for example, would look as follows:

.`CounterEndpoint.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/generated/CounterEndpoint.ts[]
----


== Objects

An endpoint method can return or receive a parameter as an object (i.e., a non-primitive type). In this case, the generator also creates a TypeScript interface for the object.

An object can be defined in the following ways:

- In a separate class that belongs to the project.
- In a class that belongs to the project dependency.
- In an inner class of an endpoint or any other class.

.`City.java`
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/accessingbackend/City.java[]
----

.`CountryEndpoint.java`
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/accessingbackend/CountryEndpoint.java[]
----

The TypeScript output is the following:

.`City.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/generated/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/accessingbackend/City.ts[]
----

.`Query.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/generated/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/accessingbackend/CountryEndpoint/Query.ts[]
----

.`CountryEndpoint.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/generated/CountryEndpoint.ts[]
----


=== Nullable & Non-Nullable Types

See <<../reference/type-nullability#, Type nullability>> for more information about how the nullability algorithm works and how to make types non-nullable.

[[cancelling-requests]]
[role="since:dev.hilla:hilla@v1.2"]
== Cancelling Endpoint Requests

Sometimes it can be useful to cancel programmatically some requests. For example, when a request is taking too long or is waiting in a queue despite no longer being needed. Hilla allows developers to cancel requests using standard https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController[AbortController].

All endpoint requests support an optional parameter that can be used to pass an `AbortSignal` which allows them to be cancelled. It's worth remembering, though, that a single `AbortController` can be used to cancel multiple requests by passing its `signal` to all of them.

The following example creates two buttons: one that makes requests to a slow endpoint method, and another that triggers the cancellation of previously created requests. If a request is subject to cancellation, errors must be handled as the endpoint method throws `AbortError`.

[source,typescript]
----
private abortController = new AbortController();

render() {
  return html`
    <div>
      <vaadin-button @click=${this.makeRequest}>Make a request</vaadin-button>
      <vaadin-button @click=${this.cancelRequest}>Cancel pending requests</vaadin-button>
    </div>
  `;
}

async makeRequest() {
  console.log("Making request");

  try {
    const serverResponse = await HelloWorldEndpoint.slow({ signal: this.abortController.signal });
    Notification.show(serverResponse);
  } catch (error: any) {
    if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
      Notification.show("Request aborted");
    } else {
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

cancelRequest() {
  console.log("Cancelling request(s)");
  this.abortController.abort();
  this.abortController = new AbortController();
}
----
endif::[]


== Endpoint URLs

Hilla automatically generates endpoint URLs and wraps them in the generated TypeScript API so the developer doesn't have to worry about them.

Even though you can access any public method in any Hilla endpoint with the `\http://${base_url}/${prefix}/${endpoint_name}/${method_name}` URL format, don't use those URLs directly. Instead use the TypeScript methods.

. The `${base_url}` is the base URL of the application, depending on the framework used. For instance, for the Spring framework the default URL, if the application is started locally, is `http://localhost:8080`. If the application is started with a context, it should be added to the end: such as, `\http://localhost:8080/my-app`.

. The `${prefix}` is the URL common part that every exposed endpoint contains. By default, `connect` is used, but this can be configured in the application properties.

. The `${endpoint_name}` is by default the corresponding Java class name which exposes methods, although this can be changed in the `@Endpoint` annotation value.

. The `${method_name}` is the public method name from the Java class.

For an application started locally with the [classname]`CounterEndpoint` endpoint defined as shown, the endpoint URL is: `\http://localhost:8080/connect/counterendpoint/addone`

[source,java]
----
@Endpoint
public class CounterEndpoint {

    public int addOne(int number) {
        return number + 1;
    }
}
----

.Endpoint URLs Aren't Case-Sensitive
[NOTE]
The endpoint name and the method name aren't case-sensitive in Hilla. Therefore, the URL shown is the same as `\http://localhost:8080/connect/CounterEndpoint/addOne` or `\http://localhost:8080/connect/COUNTERENDPOINT/ADDONE`, or any other case combination for the endpoint and method name.


=== Configuring Endpoint URLs

You can configure the following parts of the URL:

// TODO list these in the configuration reference and include here

`${prefix}`::
The default value is `connect`. To change it to some other value, provide an [filename]`application.properties` file in the project resources ([filename]`src/main/resources/application.properties`) and set the `vaadin.endpoint.prefix` property to the new value.

`${endpoint_name}`::
By default, the simple name of the Java class is taken. It's possible to specify a value in the `@Endpoint` annotation to override the default one (`@Endpoint("customName")`). In this case, the `customName` value is used as an `${endpoint_name}` to accept incoming requests. It's also case-insensitive.


== Endpoint Method Validation

The parameters of an endpoint method are automatically validated and, if validation fails, a corresponding response is sent back to the browser.

// Skipping JSR
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Abbr = NO -->]

Whenever an endpoint method is invoked, its parameters are automatically validated using the https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/[JSR 380] Bean validation specification after they're deserialized from the endpoint request body.

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Abbr = YES -->]

This is useful in eliminating the boilerplate needed for the initial request validation. The framework automatically checks the constraints placed on beans and sends the response back to the client side if the validation fails. The browser raises an [classname]`EndpointValidationError` when it receives the corresponding response from the server.


=== Built-In Validation Constraints

The built-in validation constraints are the set of annotations provided by the `jakarta.validation.validation-api` dependency. They're intended to be placed on Java beans on the server side.

You can find a full list of the constraints at https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/#builtinconstraints

To use these annotations, add them to the class field or method parameter. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Account {

  @Positive
  private Long id;

  @NotEmpty(message = "Each account must have a non-empty username")
  private String username;

  private void sendAccountData(@NotNull String destination) {
    // ...
  }
}
----


=== Custom Validation Constraints

It's possible to create custom constraints. To do this, you need to create a custom annotation and a custom validator.

See the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#validator-customconstraints[official documentation] for more details.


=== Manual Validation

Since all of the dependencies needed for validating beans and methods are present, you can reuse them in any part of your project -- not only in the endpoint methods. For example:

[source,java]
----
// A validator for validating beans
Validator validator = Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory().getValidator();
// non-empty set if there are any constraint validation errors
Set<ConstraintViolation<Object>> violations = validator.validate(bean);

// A validator for validating methods and constructors (return values, parameters)
ExecutableValidator executableValidator = validator.forExecutables();
// non-empty set if there are any constraint validation errors
Set<ConstraintViolation<Object>> violations = executableValidator.validateReturnValue(object, method, returnValue);
----

If required, you can throw an [classname]`EndpointValidationException` from an endpoint method. This exception is caught by TypeScript and the corresponding [classname]`EndpointValidationError` is raised.

See the official documentation for more details on https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-validating-bean-constraints[validating bean constraints] and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-validating-executable-constraints[validating method constraints].


=== Hilla Validation Implementation Details

Hilla validates only the beans and method parameters that are used in the endpoint classes (i.e., classes with the `@Endpoint` annotation). No other types are validated, even if they have constraint annotations.

If any validation errors occur, a non-`200` response is sent back, which is interpreted in TypeScript as a reason to throw an [classname]`EndpointValidationError`. A similar effect is achieved if an [classname]`EndpointValidationException` is thrown by any of the Java endpoint methods.



[[error-handling]]
== Error Handling

A robust client implementation should be able to handle invalid endpoint calls, errors on the server side, and network outages.

Hilla determines the success of an endpoint call by inspecting the HTTP status code. The server returns the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200[200 OK] code when it's able successfully to process the request, deserialize the method body, find and execute the particular method in the endpoint, and serialize its return value into a response.

If the status code of the response isn't `200 OK`, Hilla throws an error on the client side. The available parameters in the error and the specific class of the thrown error depend on the failure mode. The most common ones are described in the next sub-sections.


=== Missing Endpoint

If the request addresses an endpoint or a method name not present on the backend, the server responds with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404[404 Not Found] and Hilla raises an error of type `EndpointError`.


=== Parameter Validation Error

If the method called in the request exists on the backend, but the parameter count and types don't match the endpoint method, the server responds with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400[400 Bad Request] and Hilla raises an error of type [classname]`EndpointValidationException`. The error instance contains a field `validationErrorData` holding validation error information for each invalid parameter. See <<../reference/type-conversion#,Type conversion between JavaScript and Java>> for more details about the type conversion rules.

For example, the following endpoint expects a `java.time.LocalDate` parameter:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/errorhandling/DateEndpoint.java[]
----

A call with an illegal data parameter raises an [classname]`EndpointValidationException` with information about which parameters failed validation:

[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/errorhandling/catch-invalid-args.ts[]
----

ifdef::lit[]
Note that when using <<forms/binder-validation#,server-side form validation>>, validation exceptions from the server are handled automatically by the form binder.
endif::lit[]


=== Server-Side Errors

If the endpoint exists and its parameters could be passed, but its execution raises a Java runtime exception, the server responds with
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500[500 Internal Server Error]. When this happens, Hilla raises an error of type [classname]`EndpointError`. As a special case, if the server-side exception is an instance of [classname]`dev.hilla.exception.EndpointException` or a subclass, the server instead responds with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400[400 Bad Request]. Then the exception type and message passed to the [classname]`EndpointException` in Java are available in the [classname]`EndpointError` instance via the `type` and `message` attributes.

The following endpoint implementation is an example of this:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/pwa/offline/DataEndpoint.java[]
----

The following client-side call to the endpoint method logs the error message and exception type:

[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/errorhandling/catch-error.ts[]
----


=== Network Errors

When the server isn't reachable due to outage or network disruption, an endpoint call results in a low-level network error, different from [classname]`EndpointError`. Applications that support offline mode can wrap endpoint calls with exception-handling code returning a fallback value, by distinguishing between the error classes as follows:

[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/pwa/offline/ts-view-with-endpoint.ts[]
----

See the documentation about <<client-caching#,caching endpoint data in local storage>> using a generic wrapper.


=== Unexpected Response Contents

If the server replies with a response other than `200 OK`, and the string contained in the response isn't valid JSON, an [classname]`EndpointResponseError` is raised. The exception contains the response text as a message and the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response[Response] object in the `response` field.

=== Cancelled Requests

When a request is cancelled programmatically, the endpoint call promise resolves with an `AbortError`. This happens only when you explicitly cancel a request, as explained in <<cancelling-requests>>.

== Code Completion in IDEs

As you can see in the earlier [filename]`CounterEndpoint.ts` example, the Javadoc for the `@Endpoint` class is copied to the generated TypeScript file, and the type definitions are maintained. This helps code completion to work -- at least in Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition.
