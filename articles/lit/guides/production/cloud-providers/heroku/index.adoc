= Deploying a Hilla Application to Heroku

This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Hilla application to the Heroku cloud platform.
Heroku has a free-tier offering that can be used for non-commercial applications.
You can find details of their free offerings on the link:https://www.heroku.com/[Heroku website].

.Heroku account required
[NOTE]
To complete this tutorial, you need a Heroku account.
You can sign up at https://signup.heroku.com/.

== Step 1: Install and Set Up the Heroku CLI

To begin, download and install the link:https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli/[Heroku CLI].

When it has been installed, log in to your account from a terminal window using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
heroku login
----

Next, install Heroku's Java plugin by issuing the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
heroku plugins:install java
----

== Step 2: Download a Starter App

Download a minimal Hilla project and unpack the downloaded zip into a folder on your computer.

ifdef::lit[]
[source,terminal]
----
npx @hilla/cli init my-app
----
endif::[]
ifdef::react[]
[source,terminal]
----
npx @hilla/cli init --react my-app
----
endif::[]


== Step 3: Add Java 11 Support

The starter project is on Java 11, whereas, by default, Heroku expects Java 8 projects.
To ensure that Heroku will run a Java 11 environment, create a [filename]`system.properties` file under the project root directory with the following content:

.`system.properties`
[source]
----
java.runtime.version=11
----

== Step 4: Create a Production Build

Open the project directory from a terminal window, and enter the following command to generate a `JAR` file of your application:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn package -Pproduction
----

== Step 5: Initialize a Heroku Application

From a terminal window, enter the following command to initialize a Heroku application:

[source,terminal]
----
heroku create --no-remote
----

This command will create an application with a randomly generated name.
Take a note of the generated application name that appears in the logs.
For example, in the following screenshot, the generated application name is `blooming-beach-34155`.

== Step 6: Deploy the Application

To deploy the application, run the following command from a terminal in your project's root directory (replacing 'blooming-beach-34155' in the command with your application name, noted in the previous step):

[source,terminal]
----
heroku deploy:jar target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --app blooming-beach-34155
----

When the deployment has completed, the application URL will be displayed in the logs.
