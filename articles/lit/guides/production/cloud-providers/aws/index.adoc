= Deploying a Hilla Application to Amazon Web Services
:experimental:

This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Hilla application to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying web applications developed with Java (among other programming languages).
AWS offers short-term free trials from the date you activate a particular service.
You can find details of their free offerings on the link:https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS website].

.AWS account required
[NOTE]
To complete this tutorial, you need an AWS account.
You can sign up at https://aws.amazon.com/.

== Step 1: Install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI

The CLI installation requires Python to be installed on your machine.
You can download and install Python from link:https://www.python.org/downloads/[python.org/downloads].
Once Python is installed, you can install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI by running the following command from a terminal window:

[source,terminal]
----
pip install awsebcli --upgrade
----

== Step 2: Download a Starter App

Create a minimal Hilla project:

ifdef::lit[]
[source,terminal]
----
npx @hilla/cli init --lit my-app
----
endif::[]
ifdef::react[]
[source,terminal]
----
npx @hilla/cli init my-app
----
endif::[]

== Step 3: Change the Server Port

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is configured to forward requests to port 5000 by default, whereas the Hilla starter application runs on port 8080.
To change the port where the application runs, open the [filename]`application.properties` file under the [filename]`src/main/resources` directory, and change the server port from 8080 to 5000.

.`application.properties`
[source]
----
server.port=5000
----

It's also possible to change the default port from the Beanstalk side, if needed.

== Step 4: Create a Production Build

Open the project directory from a terminal window, and enter the following command to generate a `JAR` file of your application:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn package -Pproduction
----

== Step 5: Initialize a Beanstalk Project

From a terminal window, enter the following command to initialize a Beanstalk project:

[source,terminal]
----
eb init
----

You will be asked to choose a region for the project.
If you are unsure, choose the one geographically closest to you.

[source]
----
Select a default region
1) us-east-1 : US East (N. Virginia)
2) us-west-1 : US West (N. California)
3) us-west-2 : US West (Oregon)
4) eu-west-1 : EU (Ireland)
5) eu-central-1 : EU (Frankfurt)
6) ap-south-1 : Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
7) ap-southeast-1 : Asia Pacific (Singapore)
8) ap-southeast-2 : Asia Pacific (Sydney)
9) ap-northeast-1 : Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
10) ap-northeast-2 : Asia Pacific (Seoul)
11) sa-east-1 : South America (Sao Paulo)
12) cn-north-1 : China (Beijing)
13) cn-northwest-1 : China (Ningxia)
14) us-east-2 : US East (Ohio)
15) ca-central-1 : Canada (Central)
16) eu-west-2 : EU (London)
17) eu-west-3 : EU (Paris)
18) eu-north-1 : EU (Stockholm)
19) eu-south-1 : EU (Milano)
20) ap-east-1 : Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
21) me-south-1 : Middle East (Bahrain)
22) af-south-1 : Africa (Cape Town)
(default is 3):
----

Next, if this is the first time you are using the AWS CLI, you will be asked to provide your AWS credentials.
Please check the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys[AWS documentation] to learn how to create an access ID and key.

[source]
----
You have not yet set up your credentials or your credentials are incorrect
You must provide your credentials.
(aws-access-id): AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
(aws-secret-key): wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
----

After this, you will be asked to select a name for your application.
You can enter a name or accept the default `"my-app"` value.

[source]
----
Enter Application Name
(default is "my-app"):
----

Next, you will be asked if you are using `Node.js`.
Enter the letter "n", as this is a Java project.

[source]
----
It appears you are using Node.js. Is this correct?
(Y/n): n
----

Next, choose "Java" from the list of platforms.
[source]
----
Select a platform.
1) .NET Core on Linux
2) .NET on Windows Server
3) Docker
4) GlassFish
5) Go
6) Java
7) Node.js
8) PHP
9) Packer
10) Python
11) Ruby
12) Tomcat
(make a selection): 6
----

After this, for the platform branch, select "Corretto 11".

[source]
----
Select a platform branch.
1) Corretto 11 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2
2) Corretto 8 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2
3) Java 8 running on 64bit Amazon Linux (Deprecated)
4) Java 7 running on 64bit Amazon Linux (Deprecated)
(default is 1): 1
----

Finally, enter the letter "n" for the last two prompts to skip the configuration of both CodeCommit and SSH.
[source]
----
Do you wish to continue with CodeCommit? (Y/n): n
Do you want to set up SSH for your instances?
(Y/n): n
----

== Step 6: Configure Beanstalk Deployment

The project initialization performed in the previous step will have automatically created a configuration file in the project directory under [filename]`.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml`.
Now you need to configure the deployment instructions to point to the project's `JAR` by adding the following setting to the [filename]`config.yml` file:

.`config.yml`
[source,yml]
----
deploy:
  artifact: target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

== Step 6: Create a Beanstalk Environment

Next, you need to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
eb create --single
----

This command will create an AWS environment with a single EC2 instance.

After this, you will be prompted to enter an environment name and a DNS `CNAME` prefix.
You can keep the defaults.

[source]
----
Enter Environment Name
(default is my-app-dev):
Enter DNS CNAME prefix
(default is my-app-dev):
----

Next, enter the letter "N" when prompted for whether you want to enable Spot Fleet:

[source]
----
Would you like to enable Spot Fleet requests for this environment? (y/N): N
----

If this is the first time you are running the AWS CLI, you might be asked to create a service role for your account.
This service role is required in order to create the Beanstalk environment.
To create this service role, you should press kbd:[Enter] when you see the following prompt:

[source]
----
2.0+ Platforms require a service role. We will attempt to create one for you. You can specify your own role using the --service-role option.
Type "view" to see the policy, or just press ENTER to continue:
----

The creation of the environment takes a moment to finish.

Your application URL appears in the logs as shown in the following screenshot.

== Step 7: Deploy Your Application

From the terminal window, enter the following command to deploy your app:

[source,terminal]
----
eb deploy
----

When the deployment has finished, the application is accessible from the URL specified in the logs, as described in the previous step.
