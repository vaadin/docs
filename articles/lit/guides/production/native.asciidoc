= GraalVM Native Image Compilation

Hilla 2 uses Spring Boot 3 and supports GraalVM native image compilation. By compiling your application into a native image, you can benefit from faster startup times (in just a few milliseconds) and lower memory consumption compared to running the app on the JVM.

This documentation page will guide you through the process of compiling your Hilla project into a native image using GraalVM.

== Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

. A Hilla 2 (or newer) project.
. A JDK with GraalVM support installed.

== Compilation Steps

To compile your Hilla application into a native image, follow these steps:

=== Step 1: Compile the Application

Compile your application using Maven by executing the following command in your project's root directory:

[source,bash]
mvn -Pproduction -Pnative native:compile

This command will compile your application with the production and native profiles enabled. The native profile will instruct Maven to use the GraalVM native image compiler for the compilation process.

=== Step 2: Run the Application
The compilation creates the native image in the target directory. To run the application, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
./target/<app-name>

Your Hilla application is now running as a native image, benefiting from faster startup times and lower memory consumption.
