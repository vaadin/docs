= [since:dev.hilla:hilla@v2]#Native image compilation with GraalVM#

Hilla uses Spring Boot 3 and supports native image compilation with GraalVM. By compiling your application into a native image, you can benefit from much faster startup times (milliseconds) and lower memory consumption compared to running the application on the JVM.


== Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have a JDK with GraalVM support.
// TODO we should list the options or at least provide some guidance how to make sure you have such a JDK


== Compilation steps

To compile your Hilla application into a native image, follow these steps:

. *Compile your application* using Maven by executing the following command in the project root directory:
+
[source,bash]
mvn -Pproduction -Pnative native:compile
+
This command compiles your application with the production and native profiles enabled. The native profile instructs Maven to use the GraalVM native image compiler for the compilation process.

. *Run the application*. The compilation creates the native image in the target directory. To run the application, execute the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
./target/<app-name>
----
+
Your Hilla application is now running as a native image, benefiting from faster startup times and lower memory consumption.
