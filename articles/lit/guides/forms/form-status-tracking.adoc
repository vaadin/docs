= Reacting to Form State Changes

// tag::content[]

You can display some parts of the form differently, depending on the form state. For example, you can disable the [guibutton]#Submit# button when the form has validation errors, or show an _'operation in progress'_ spinner while an async form submission is in progress.

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
export default function ProfileView() {

    const form = useForm(EntityModel);

    return (
      <>
        ...
        <Button disabled={form.invalid}>submit</Button>
      </>
    );
}
----
endif::[]
ifdef::lit[]
[source,html]
----
<vaadin-button ?disabled=${this.binder.invalid}>
  Submit
</vaadin-button>
----
endif::[]

The following properties are available both for the form as a whole, and for each field independently.
They are a part of the <<reference#binder-node,`BinderNode`>> interface.
ifdef::react[]
You can access form status properties for the whole form from the [classname]`UseFormResult` instance returned from [methodname]`useForm`:
[source,tsx]
----
const form = useForm(EntityModel);

const invalid = form.invalid;
const dirty = form.dirty;
const errors = form.errors;
...
----
To access form status properties for individual fields, use the [classname]`UseFormPartResult` instance returned from [methodname]`useFormPart`:
[source,tsx]
----
const form = useForm(EntityModel);
const nameField = useFormPart(form.model.name);

const invalid = nameField.invalid;
const dirty = nameField.dirty;
const errors = nameField.errors;
----
endif::[]
ifdef::lit[]
You can access these properties either for a single field, for example `binder.for(model.firstname).dirty`, or for the entire form, for example `binder.dirty`.
endif::[]

- `dirty`: true if the value of the form or field has been modified by the user
- `visited`: true if the form or field has been focused by the user
- `invalid`: true if the form or field has validation errors
- `required`: true if the form or field is required
- `errors`: a list of all validation errors for a form or field and its sub-fields
- `ownErrors`: a list of all the validation errors for a field (without sub-fields) or for the form (not specific to any field)


The following properties are available for the form as a whole, but not for individual fields. They're a part of the <<reference#binder,`Binder`>> interface. For example, you can access these properties via `binder.validating`.

- `validating`: true if the form is performing some validation
- `submitting`: true if the form is submitting the data to a callback


== Example: Disable the Form While Submission Is in Progress

If form submission could take a long time, it's usually a good idea to give users a quick visual indication that something is happening. You may also want to prevent more form submissions until the first one is completed (for example, in a payment form).

With the TypeScript `Binder` API, this can be done using the `submitting` property. In the following example, `binder.submitting` is bound to the `disabled` property of the [guibutton]#Submit# button to disable repeating form submissions. It's also used as a condition to render an additional 'submitting' message.

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
export default function ProfileView() {

    const {model, submit, field, invalid, submitting} = useForm(PersonModel, {
        onSubmit: async (e) => {
          await PersonEndpoint.sendEntity(e);
        }
      });

    return (
      <>
        <VerticalLayout theme="spacing padding">
          <TextField label="First name" {...field(model.firstName)}></TextField>
          <TextField label="Last name" {...field(model.lastName)}></TextField>
        </VerticalLayout>
        <HorizontalLayout theme="spacing padding">
          <Button theme="primary" onClick={submit} disabled={invalid || submitting}>Save</Button>
          <span className="label" style={{visibility: submitting ? 'visible' : 'hidden' }}>submitting</span>
          <div className="spinner" style={{visibility: submitting ? 'visible' : 'hidden' }}></div>
          </HorizontalLayout>
      </>
    );
}

ifdef::lit[]
[source,html]
----
<vaadin-form-layout>
  <vaadin-text-field label="First name" ${field(model.firstname)}></vaadin-text-field>
  <vaadin-text-field label="Last name" ${field(model.lastname)}></vaadin-text-field>
</vaadin-form-layout>

<vaadin-horizontal-layout>
  <vaadin-button
    theme="primary"
    @click="${this.save}"
    ?disabled="${this.binder.invalid || this.binder.submitting}"
  >
    Save
  </vaadin-button>

  ${this.binder.submitting
    ? html`
        <span class="label">submitting</span>
        <div class="spinner"></div>
      `
    : nothing}
</vaadin-horizontal-layout>

== Example: List All Validation Errors if Validation Fails

Sometimes you may want to list all validation errors in one place. This is convenient especially in large forms, where it can be difficult to find _that one field_ that failed the validation.

With the TypeScript `Binder` API, this can be done using the `errors` property. In the following example, the form template iterates over the `form.errors` list and renders the full list under the form.

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
<dl>
  {form.errors.map(error => (
      <>
        <dt>{error.property as string}</dt>
        <dt>{error.message as string}</dt>
      </>
  ))}
</dl>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::lit[]
[source,html]
----
(<dl>
  ${this.binder.errors.map(error => html`
    <dt>${error.property}</dt>
    <dd>${error.message}</dd>
  `)}
</dl>)
----
endif::[]

== Example: Populate a Field based on Another Field's Value

Sometimes you may want to populate a field based on the value of another field. For example, you may want to set the value of a `city` select field based on the value of a `country` select field.

In such cases, you can use the `useEffect` Hook to react to changes in the value of the first field, and update the value of the second field accordingly. The following simplified example shows how to do this.

[source,tsx]
----
const form = useForm(MyModel);
useEffect(() => {
        // Do something here to change the value of the second 
		// field based on the first field value
    }, [form.value.firstField]);
----
