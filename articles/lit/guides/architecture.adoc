= Application Architecture

Hilla applications are written in TypeScript and they run on a single HTML page.
An application consists of one or more views, each bound to a _route_ (i.e. URL path).
To access business data and logic, an application can have server-side _endpoints_ written in Java.


== Project Structure

The following files are important parts of a Hilla project:

[filename]`frontend/index.html`::
A bootstrap page that loads the application.
You don't normally need to modify this file.

[filename]`frontend/index.ts`::
The TypeScript entry point of the application.
You don't normally need to modify this file.

[filename]`frontend/views/`::
Most of your application consists of <<views,views>>. It's not required, but you should place your view implementations in this folder.

[filename]`frontend/routes.ts`::
This is where you set up <<routes,routing>> and other application tasks.
+
// TODO explain frontend/stores folder

[filename]`frontend/themes/<app-name>/styles.css`::
The main style sheet for your application theme, where you can add your custom CSS.

[filename]`src/main/java/`::
You define your server-side endpoints here, using Java packages and classes. <<endpoints,Endpoints>> allow your client-side views access to the back-end data.
+
// TODO explain src/main/resources




[[views]]
== Application Views

Most of the application logic is handled in application views.
You could have a login view, registration view, main view, and various other views.

Views in a Hilla application are custom HTML elements that extend [classname]`LitElement`, [classname]`View`, or [classname]`Layout`, which handle rendering the component state reactively.
You minimally need to implement a [methodname]`render()` function that returns the rendered HTML representation of the component.
You can also provide custom styling by implementing a [methodname]`styles()` function that returns custom CSS.
See <<{articles}/lit/components/create#, Creating components>> for a more thorough introduction to using [classname]`LitElement`.

The following is an example of a view in Hilla:

[.example.show-code]
--
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/application/basic/my-view.ts[render, tags=snippet, indent=0]
----
--

To have a typical main view with menu navigation and multiple sub-views, you can use the https://vaadin.com/docs/components/app-layout[App Layout] component.



=== Introduction to Reactive UIs

Views in Hilla applications are programmed in a _reactive_, rather than an imperative, manner, as you would with Vaadin Flow, jQuery, and so forth.
Reactive views have fewer moving parts and, because of this, they are easier to understand and debug.
In reactive UI programming, the application UI is the value of a function.
The function gets the component's state as a parameter and returns HTML.
Whenever the state changes, the UI is re-rendered.

[.example.show-code]
--
In reactive programming, there is only one state: the data.
The UI always reflects that state.
You define a template using values from the state.
Whenever the model changes, the template is automatically updated.

[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/application/basic/reactive-view.ts[render, tags=snippet, indent=0]

////
// TODO Move this elsewhere, too deep stuff here.
.Avoid element references in reactive views
[TIP]
====
As a rule of thumb, you shouldn't use `document.querySelector` or LitElement `@query` to get element reference in order to set values or properties imperatively.
There is almost always a way to achieve the same with binding values through the template.

[[routes]]
== Routing

To see a view in the browser, and to navigate between the views, you need to define client-side _routes_ for them.
A route is a path in the URL.
This requires the following changes in the [filename]`routes.ts` file:

.`frontend/routes.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
import { Router } from '@vaadin/router';
import './my-view'; // <1>

export const routes = [
  // other views
  { path: 'my-view-path', component: 'my-view' }, // <2>
];
----
<1> Import the view.
<2> Define the route mapping.

Now `my-view` is accessible at the `my-view-path` path, that is, `http://localhost:8080/my-view-path`.
See <<routing#,Routing and navigation>> for more details.






[[endpoints]]
== Accessing Backend Data

Hilla provides a type-safe and secure way to access data from the backend in frontend views by using generated TypeScript code.
Hilla scans the backend code during development and generates TypeScript code that can be used to call the corresponding Java methods.
The generated code is processed in the same way as other TypeScript views.
Only the necessary code is included in the production application bundle.

See <<endpoints#, Endpoints>> for more information.
