= Using Vaadin Components in Hilla

When bootstrapping a Hilla project with the CLI, all Vaadin components are automatically installed.
To use a component in a view, it's enough to import it into the view [filename]`.ts` file.
For example:

[source,typescript]
----
import '@vaadin/text-field';
----

You can then use the https://vaadin.com/docs/components/text-field[Text Field] component (the `<vaadin-text-field>` element) in your view's [methodname]`render()` method:

[source,typescript]
----
render() {
  return html`
    <vaadin-text-field id="firstname" label="First name"></vaadin-text-field>
    <vaadin-text-field id="lastname" label="Last name"></vaadin-text-field>
  `;
}
----

== Component Class

The class name of a `<vaadin-_component-name_>` element follows the pattern `__ComponentName__`.
Importing the class gives type-safe access to the component's API.
For example:

[source,typescript,role=show-code]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/components/greeting-view.ts[render]
----

In the preceding example, the https://vaadin.com/docs/components/combo-box[Combo Box] and https://vaadin.com/docs/components/checkbox[Checkbox] components with the IDs `greeting` and `custom` respectively are mapped to typed class variables of the same names via the `@query` decorator.
The Checkbox event listener toggles the `allowCustomValue` property of the Combo Box, which defines whether the user can enter custom values into the field or is constrained to the alternatives in the items overlay.
Having strongly typed class variables helps to catch errors at compile time and allows code completion in the IDE.

== HTML Attributes

The following HTML attributes work as expected with most Vaadin components:

`disabled`::
Whether the component is enabled; a disabled component cannot be interacted with.

`title`::
Additional label associated with the component, shown as a tooltip.

`hidden`::
Visibility; set this attribute to hide the element.

See the https://vaadin.com/docs/components[Vaadin documentation] for a full list of components and detailed API documentation.

See the <<../guides/styling#, Styling>> page to learn how to style the components.
