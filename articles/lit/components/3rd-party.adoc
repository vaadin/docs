= Integrating Components

To use 3rd-party components in Hilla, you first need to install the component from the https://npmjs.com[npm package registry].

For example, the following command installs the latest version of the `vanilla-colorful` color picker component and adds the dependency in the [filename]`package.json` file in your project:

[source,terminal]
npm i vanilla-colorful

After installation, you can import and use the component in a view.

The following example shows the hex triplet of the selected color in a https://vaadin.com/docs/components/text-field[Text Field]:
