== Receiving TypeScript Values in Java

When calling a Java endpoint method from TypeScript, [classname]`ConnectClient` serializes TypeScript call parameters to JSON and sends them to the Java backend. There they're deserialized into Java types using the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] JSON processing library. The return value of the Java endpoint method is sent back to TypeScript through the same pipeline in the opposite direction.


=== JSON Object Mapper

The default Hilla JSON [classname]`ObjectMapper` follows the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-json.html#boot-features-json-jackson[Spring Boot auto-configuration] defaults.

The visibility level of the default [classname]`ObjectMapper` can be configured by setting the `spring.jackson.visibility` property in https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html[common application properties].

Other properties of the default [classname]`ObjectMapper` can be customized by following the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-spring-mvc.html#howto-customize-the-jackson-objectmapper[Spring Boot documentation] on the subject. Alternatively, the entire [classname]`ObjectMapper` can be replaced with a custom one by providing an `ObjectMapper` bean with the qualifier defined in `com.vaadin.connect.HillaConnectController#VAADIN_ENDPOINT_MAPPER_BEAN_QUALIFIER`.

The default [classname]`ObjectMapper` always converts TypeScript values to a JSON object before sending them to the backend, so that the values need to be compliant with the JSON specification. This only accepts values from the following types: `string`, `number`, `array`, `boolean`, JSON object or `null`. This implies that `NaN` and `Infinity` are non-compliant. If these values are sent, the server returns an error response: `400 Bad Request`. Sending a parameter of `undefined` from TypeScript results in default values for primitive types, `null` for a Java object, and `Optional.empty()` for `Optional`.


[discrete]
=== Default Conversion Rules

The default conversion rules are summarized in the following table. Incidentally, TypeScript-compliant values are converted to the corresponding values, otherwise the backend returns an error message.


=== Primitive Types

[.small]
[cols="1,2,2,3"]
|===
| Type | Compliant Values | Non-Compliant Values | Overflow/Underflow Values

| `boolean`
| A boolean value: `true` -> `true`, `false` -> `false`.
| Any value that's not a valid `boolean` type in TypeScript.
| N/A

| `char`
| A single character string: `'a'` -> `'a'`.footnote:[Both Java and TypeScript internally use UTF-16 for string encoding. This makes string conversion between backend and frontend trivial. However, using UTF-16 has its limitations and corner cases. Most notably, a string like `"🥑"` might seem like a single-character that can be passed to Java as a `char`. However, both in TypeScript and Java, it's actually a two-character string, because the `U+1F951` symbol takes two characters in UTF-16: `\uD83E\uDD51`. Thus, it's not a valid value for the Java `char` type.]
| Any string value that has more than one character. Any value that's not a valid `string` type in TypeScript.
| N/A

| `byte`
| An integer or decimal number in the range `-129 < X < 256`. `100`, `100.0`, and `100.9` -> `100`
| Any value which isn't a number in TypeScript. Any number value which is outside the compliant range.
| If TypeScript sends a value which is greater than Java's `Byte.MAX_VALUE` (2^8^ &minus; 1), the bits are rolled over. For example, if you send a value of `128` (`Byte.MAX_VALUE + 1`), the Java side receives `-128`(`Byte.MIN_VALUE`). If the Java side expects a `byte` value but TypeScript sends an underflow number, for example `-129` (`Byte.MIN_VALUE &minus; 1`), the backend returns an error.

| `short`
| An integer or decimal number in the range `-2^16^ < X < 2^16^ &minus; 1`. `100`, `100.0` and `100.9` -> `100`.
| Any value which isn't a number in TypeScript. Any number value which is outside the compliant range.
| Overflow and underflow numbers aren't accepted for `short`.

| `int`
| An integer or decimal number: `100`, `100.0` and `100.9` -> `100`.
| Any value which isn't a number in TypeScript.
| If TypeScript sends a value which is greater than Java's `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (2^31^ &minus; 1), the bits get rolled over. For example, if you send a value of `2^31^` (`Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1`), the Java side receives `-2^31^` (`Integer.MIN_VALUE`). _Underflows_ are the reverse of the overflow case. If you send `-2^31^ &minus; 1` (`Integer.MIN_VALUE &minus; 1`), the Java side receives `2^31^ &minus; 1` (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`).

| `long`
| An integer or decimal number: `100`, `100.0` and `100.9` -> `100`.
| Any value which isn't a number in TypeScript.
| Bits are rolled over when receiving overflow/underflow numbers; that is, `2^63^` -> `-2^63^`, `-2^63^ &minus; 1` -> `2^63^ &minus; 1`.

| `float`, `double`
| An integer or decimal number: `100` and `100.0` -> `100.0`, `100.9` -> `100.9`.
| Any value which isn't a number in TypeScript.
| Overflow and underflow numbers are converted to `Infinity` and `-Infinity`, respectively.
|===


=== Boxed Primitive Types

The conversion works in the same way as primitive types.


=== String

`String` values are kept the same when sent from TypeScript to the Java backend.


=== Date-time types

[.small]
[cols="2,3,2"]
|===
| Type | Compliant values | Non-compliant values

| `java.util.Date`
| A string that represents a timestamp in epoch, ISO-8601, or RFC-1123 format is converted to a `java.util.Date` instance. 

That is to say, an epoch timestamp in milliseconds (e.g., `'1571660184000'`), or an 
ISO-8601 formatted date (e.g. `2019-10-21T12:16:24.000+00:00`), or a RFC-1123 date (e.g., `Sun, 21 Oct 2019 12:16:24 GMT`) will each be converted to the same value and format (e.g., `2019-10-21:12:16.24.000+0000`).
| A non-number string that does not conform neither to ISO-8601 nor to RFC-1123 format (e.g., `'foo'`).

| `java.time.Instant`
| A string that represents an epoch timestamp in seconds. For example, `'1546300800'` is converted to a `java.time.Instant` instance that contains the value of `2019-01-01T00:00:00Z`.

Also, a string that follows the `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter#ISO_INSTANT` format (i.e., `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'`) is converted the same way.
| A non-number string that does not conform to `ISO_INSTANT` format (e.g., `'foo'`).

| `java.time.LocalDate`
| A string that follows the `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter#ISO_LOCAL_DATE` format `yyyy-MM-dd` (e.g., `'2018-12-16'`, `'2019-01-01'`).
| An incorrect-format string (e.g., `'foo'`).

| `java.time.LocalDateTime`
| A string that follows the `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter#ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME` format: with full time, `'2019-01-01T12:34:56'`; without seconds, `'2019-01-01T12:34'`; with full time and milliseconds, `'2019-01-01T12:34:56.78'`.
| An incorrect-format string (e.g., `'foo'`).
|===


=== Enum

++++
<style>
dd .code-example.code-example {
  --docs-code-example-margin: 0;
}
</style>
++++

A compliant TypeScript value is a string which equals an enum name in Java. The Java `enum` type is mapped to an `enum` TypeScript type. It's an object type, so you can work with it as you work with regular TypeScript objects.

[.small]
`enum` type in Java::
+
[source,java]
----
public enum Enumeration {
    FIRST,
    SECOND,
}
----

Generated `enum` type in TypeScript::
+
[source,typescript]
----
export enum Enumeration {
  FIRST = "FIRST",
  SECOND = "SECOND"
}
----

[.small]
.Complex Java enum Mapping
[NOTE]
The `enum` type is mapped in a simple way. No constructor-related Java features are available in the TypeScript `enum`.

[.small]
Complex `enum` type in Java::
+
[source,java]
----
public enum Enumeration {
    FIRST("ONE"),
    SECOND("TWO");

    private String value;

    public Enumeration(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
----

Generated complex `enum` type in TypeScript::
+
[source,typescript]
----
export enum Enumeration {
  FIRST = "FIRST",
  SECOND = "SECOND"
}
----

// For example, if you have the enum declaration in the following code example, then sending `"FIRST"` from TypeScript would result in an instance of `FIRST` with `value=1` in Java.

// [source,java]
// ----
// public enum TestEnum {

//   FIRST(1), SECOND(2), THIRD(3);

//   private final int value;

//   TestEnum(int value) {
//     this.value = value;
//   }

//   public int getValue() {
//     return this.value;
//   }
// }
// ----

Non-compliant values:

* A non-matched string with name of the expected enum type.
* Any other types: `boolean`, `number`, `object`, or `array`.



=== Array

Compliant TypeScript values are arrays of items with the same type as is expected in Java. For example:

[.small]
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Expected type in Java | TypeScript value | Converted value in Java

| `int[]`
| `[1, 2, 3]` +
`[1.9, 2, 3]`
| `[1, 2, 3]` +
`[1, 2, 3]`


| `String[]`
| `["foo", "bar"]`
| `["foo", "bar"]`

| `Object[]`
| `["foo", 1, null, "bar"]`
| `["foo", 1, null, "bar"]`
|===

Values of any other type are non-compliant, for example, `true`, `"foo"`, `"[1,2,3]"`, or `1`.


=== Collection

Compliant TypeScript values are arrays of items with the same type as expected in Java, or types that can be converted to the expected type. For example:

[.small]
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Expected type in Java | TypeScript value | Converted value in Java

| `Collection<Integer>`
| `[1, 2, 3]`
| `[1, 2, 3]`

| `Collection<String>`
| `["foo", "bar"]`
| `["foo", "bar"]`

| `Set<Integer>`
| `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
| `[1, 2, 3]`
|===

Values of any other type are non-compliant, for example: `true`, `"foo"`, `"[1,2,3]"`, or `1`.


=== Map

Compliant values are TypeScript objects with a `string` key and a value of the expected type in Java. For example, if the expected type in Java is `Map<String, Integer>`, the compliant object in TypeScript should have a type of `{ [key: string]: number; }` (e.g., `{one: 1, two: 2}`). Values of any other type are non-compliant.

Due to the fact that the TypeScript code is generated from the OpenAPI <<endpoint-generator#,TypeScript Endpoints Generator>> and the OpenAPI specification has https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/dictionaries/[a limitation for the map type], the map key is always a `string` in TypeScript.


=== Bean

A bean is parsed from the input JSON object, which maps the keys of the JSON object to the property name of the bean object. You can also use Jackson's annotation to customize your bean object. For more information about the annotations, see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations[Jackson Annotations].

As an example, assume that you have <<bean-example>>. A valid input for the bean would look like this:

----
{
  "name": "MyBean",
  "address": "MyAddress",
  "age": 10,
  "isAdmin": true,
  "customProperty": "customValue"
}
----

[[bean-example]]
.Bean example
[source,java]
----
public class MyBean {
  public String name;
  public String address;
  public int age;
  public boolean isAdmin;
  private String customProperty;

  @JsonGetter("customProperty")
  public String getCustomProperty() {
    return customProperty;
  }

  @JsonSetter("customProperty")
  public void setCustomProperty(String customProperty) {
    this.customProperty = customProperty;
  }
}
----


[[java-values-in-typescript]]
== Receiving Java Types in TypeScript

The same object mapper used when converting from <<typescript-values-in-java>> deserializes the return values in Java to the corresponding JSON object before sending them to the client side.

Type Conversion can be customized by using annotations on the object to serialize, as described in <<custom-type-conversion,Customizing Type Conversion>>.


=== Number Type

// Skipping "There is..."
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.ThereIs = NO -->]

All Java types that extend [classname]`java.lang.Number` are deserialized to `number` in TypeScript. There are a few exceptions with extremely large or extremely small numbers. The safe integer range is from `-(2^53^ &minus; 1)` to `2^53^ &minus; 1`. This means that only numbers in this range can be represented exactly and compared correctly. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isSafeInteger[more information about safe integers].

In fact, not all `long` numbers in Java can be converted correctly to TypeScript, since its range is `-2^63^` to `2^63^ &minus; 1`. Unsafe numbers are rounded using the rules defined in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754#Rounding_rules[IEEE-754 standard].

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.ThereIs = YES -->]

Special values such as `NaN`, `POSITIVE_INFINITY` and `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` are converted into `string` when sent to TypeScript.


=== String Type

The primitive type `char`, its boxed type `Character` and `String` in Java are converted to `string` type in TypeScript.


=== Boolean Type

The `boolean` and `Boolean` in Java are converted to `boolean` type when received in TypeScript.


=== Array of Items

Normal array types such as `int[]`, `MyBean[]` and all types that implement or extend [classname]`java.lang.Collection` become `array` when they are sent to TypeScript.


=== Object

Any kind of object in Java is converted to the corresponding defined type in TypeScript. For example, if the endpoint method returns a [classname]`MyBean` type, when you call the method, you'll receive an object of type [classname]`MyBean`. If the generator cannot get information about your bean, it returns an object of type `any`.


=== Map

All types that inherit from [classname]`java.lang.Map` become objects in TypeScript with `string` keys and values of the corresponding type. For instance: `Map<String, Integer>` => `{ [key: string]: number; }`.


=== Datetime

By default, the [classname]`ObjectMapper` converts Java's date time to a string in TypeScript, with the following formats:

- `java.util.Date` of `00:00:00 January 1st, 2019` => `'2019-01-01T00:00:00.000+0000'`

- `java.time.Instant` of `00:00:00 January 1st, 2019` => `'2019-01-01T00:00:00Z'`

- `java.time.LocalDate` of `00:00:00 January 1st, 2019` => `'2019-01-01'`

- `java.time.LocalDateTime` of `00:00:00 January 1st, 2019` => `'2019-01-01T00:00:00'`


=== Null

Returning `null` from Java throws a validation exception in TypeScript, unless the return type is `Optional` or the endpoint method is annotated with `@Nullable` (`jakarta.annotation.Nullable`).


[[custom-type-conversion]]
== Custom Type Conversions

When serializing and deserializing data in Java endpoints, you might be interested in renaming properties and excluding certain properties and types.

Omitting properties helps the application avoid sending sensitive data, such as password fields. Leaving out types helps to simplify the TypeScript-exported classes, and to avoid circular dependencies in the serialized JSON output.

Hilla relies on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] JSON library to do serialization, so it's possible to use their https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations/wiki/Jackson-Annotations[annotations] to rename properties or exclude data.


=== The `@JsonProperty` Annotation

The `@JsonProperty` annotation is used to define a method as a setter or getter for a logical property, or to define a field to be serialized and deserialized as a specific logical property.

The annotation value indicates the name of the property in the JSON object. By default, it takes the Java name of the method or field.

[source,java]
----
public class Student {
    @JsonProperty("bookId")
    private String id;
    private String name;

    @JsonProperty("name")
    public void setFirstName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @JsonProperty("name")
    public String getFirstName() {
        return name;
    }

    @JsonProperty
    public int getRating() {
        return StudentRating.getRatingFor(name);
    }
}
----


=== The `@JsonIgnore` Annotation

The `@JsonIgnore` annotation indicates that the logical property used in serializing and deserializing for the accessor (i.e., field, getter or setter) is to be ignored.

[source,java]
----
@JsonIgnore
private String category;
----

[source,java]
----
@JsonIgnore
public String getCategory() {
    return category;
}
----

[source,java]
----
@JsonIgnore
public void setCategory(String category) {
    this.category = category;
}
----


=== The `@JsonIgnoreProperties` Annotation

The `@JsonIgnoreProperties` annotation ignores a set of logical properties in serializing and deserializing. It must be used at class level.

[source,java]
----
@JsonIgnoreProperties(value = { "id"}, allowGetters = true)
public class Product {
    private String id;
    private String name;

    ...
}
----

In addition to the properties passed as the annotation value, the `@JsonIgnoreProperties` annotation accepts the following options:

// Ignoring these section headings
pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->]


==== allowSetters

For ignored properties, `allowSetters` allows you to set properties when deserializing, but doesn't list them in serialization.

In the following snippet, `password` would not be in the payload returned to TypeScript, but TypeScript can set it:

[source,java]
----
@JsonIgnoreProperties(value = { "password"}, allowSetters = true)
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String password;

    ...
}
----


==== allowGetters

For ignored properties, `allowGetters` lists them in the serialized object, but doesn't allow you to set it.

This is useful for read-only properties:

[source,java]
----
@JsonIgnoreProperties(value = { "id"}, allowGetters = true)
public class Product {
    private String id;
    private String name;

    ...
}
----


==== ignoreUnknown

During deserializing, `ignoreUnknown` prevents an error caused by the presence of a property in the JSON object that has no corresponding property in the Java class.

This is a corner case, and shouldn't be necessary in Hilla, since the TypeScript-generated API shouldn't pass unknown properties.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]

=== The `@JsonIgnoreType` Annotation

The `@JsonIgnoreType` annotation is a class-level annotation that indicates that all properties of the annotated class type should be ignored during serializing and deserializing.

In the following example, the field `client` in [classname]`Sale` is omitted in the JSON result.

[source,java]
----
@JsonIgnoreType
public class Client {
    ...
}

@JsonIgnoreProperties(value = { "password"}, allowSetters = true)
public class Sale {
    private Client client;

    private Product product;
    private int amount;
    private double total;

    ...
}
----
