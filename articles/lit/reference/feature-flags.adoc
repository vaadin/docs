`hillaPush`::

`hillaEngine`::
Support for multi-module projects and all JVM languages (e.g. Kotlin). See <<configuration#java-compiler-options,Configuration>> for details.

== Managing feature flags

Feature flags can be managed in different ways:

- Using Vaadin/Hilla Developer Tools;
- Editing the feature flags properties file; or
- Setting Java system properties.

System properties always have the highest priority.
Since they aren't written into the feature flags properties file, they're valid only for a single execution.

=== Using Vaadin/Hilla developer tools

. Click the Vaadin/Hilla developer tools icon button in your application in bottom right corner of the browser during development.
. Open the [guilabel]*Experimental Features* tab.
. Click the toggle buttons to enable or disable features.
. Restart the application.

=== Editing the properties file

. Create or edit the [filename]`src/main/resources/vaadin-featureflags.properties` file in your application folder.
. Add a line for every feature in the format of `com.vaadin.experimental.<FEATURE_NAME>=true`. Below is an example:
+
.`vaadin-featureflags.properties`
[source,properties]
----
vaadin.experimental.hillaPush=true
----
. To disable a feature, remove the corresponding line or set the value to `false`.
. Restart the application.

=== Setting Java system properties

On the command line, use the IDE launch configuration or tool configuration – such as, Spring Boot Maven plugin – to set a system property for every feature flags to be enabled or disabled.
The property name should be in the format `vaadin.<FEATURE_NAME>`, like so:

.Terminal
[source,bash]
-Dvaadin.hillaPush=true

To temporarily disable a feature, use `false` as property value, like this:

.Terminal
[source,bash]
-Dvaadin.hillaPush=false
