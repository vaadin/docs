:wizard-name: Vaadin Start

The recommended way to start a new Vaadin project is to use *{wizard-name}*.
It allows you to configure and download a customized starting point for your application.

Once you have downloaded a starter project and have it extracted in a local folder, you can import it to your favorite IDE (integrated development environment) and start developing it further.
