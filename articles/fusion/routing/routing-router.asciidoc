= Vaadin Router

Vaadin Router is a small yet powerful client-side router JavaScript library.
It uses a widely adopted `express.js` syntax for routers (users/:id) to map URLs to views.
It has all the features of a modern router: async route resolution, animated transition, child routes, navigation guards, redirects, and more.

Vaadin router works with Web Components regardless of how they are created, it also offers a JavaScript API for regular HTML elements.

Vaadin Router is distributed as the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaadin/vaadin-router[`@vaadin/vaadin-router`^] npm package.
It is included into link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaadin/vaadin-core[`@vaadin/vaadin-core`^], and is automatically included into any Vaadin application.

== Using the Router

Add Vaadin Router into the `index.ts` file by using the `import` statement, then create and export a `router` instance by passing the outlet element in the `index.html` file:

.index.html
[source, html]
----
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My App</h1>
    <div id="outlet"></div>
  </body>
</html>
----

.index.ts
[source, typescript]
----
import {Router} from '@vaadin/router';
const outlet = document.querySelector('#outlet');
export const router = new Router(outlet);
----

Router configuration is done by using a set of routes that map URL paths to components.

Vaadin Router goes through the routes until the first match is found, then it creates an element instance for the component specified by the route, and inserts this element in the router outlet, replacing any pre-existing elements.

[source, typescript]
----
router.setRoutes([
  {
    path: 'help',
    component: 'app-help',
    action: async () => { await import('./views/app-help-view'); }
  },
  {
    path: 'categories',
    component: 'app-categories',
    action: async () => { await import('./views/app-categories-view'); }
  }
]);
----

The `router` instance can be imported and used in the componentâ€™s file:

[source, typescript]
.app-help.ts
----
import {customElement, html, LitElement, property} from 'lit-element';
import {router} from './index';

@customElement('app-help')
class AppHelpElement extends LitElement {
  @property({type: Object}) location = router.location;

  render() {
    return html`
      <p>Your location URL: ${this.location.getUrl()}</p>
      <nav>
        <a href="${router.urlForPath('/categories')}">Categories</a>
      </nav>
    `;
  }
}
