TypeScript routes, typically for views or sub-views, are defined in a `Router` instance in the `index.ts` script.
If you also have server-side views defined in Java, you need to configure the router to fall back to those.

A typical router configuration that supports both TypeScript and Java routes goes as follows:

.index.ts
[source, "TypeScript"]
----
import {Router} from '@vaadin/router';
import {Flow} from '@vaadin/flow-frontend';

// Get the server-side routes from imports generated in the server
const {serverSideRoutes} = new Flow({
  imports: () => import('../target/frontend/generated-flow-imports')
});

export const router = new Router(document.querySelector('#outlet'));
router.setRoutes([
  // A single route here
  {
    path: 'users',            // The route
  	component: 'users-view',  // The component handling the route
    // Import the view component when needed
  	action: async () => { await import ('./views/users/users-view'); },
  },
  // For server-side, the next magic line sends all unmatched routes:
  ...serverSideRoutes // IMPORTANT: this must be the last entry in the array
]);
----

Client-side routes are explicitly listed in the configuration, and server-side routes are added there through the `serverSideRoutes` variable.

In the example above, we have a single client-side route `users`, which maps to a `users-view` component.
It would be defined in a file `views/users/users-view.ts` under the `frontend` folder where the `index.ts` is located.

In the following sections, we break up the client-side and server-side routing.

== Pure Client Side Routing

In a pure TypeScript application with no server-side Java routes, you can configure routing as follows:

.index.ts
[source, "TypeScript"]
----
import {Router} from '@vaadin/router';

export const router = new Router(document.querySelector('#outlet'));
router.setRoutes([
  // A single route here
  {
    path: 'users',            // The route
  	component: 'users-view',  // The component handling the route
    // Import the view component when needed
  	action: async () => { await import ('./views/users/users-view'); },
  }
]);
----

== Connecting with Server Side Routing

In the example earlier, we defined connecting with server-side routes defined in Java.
This allows combining client-side views created in TypeScript with server-side views created in Java using the `@Route` annotation.
Routing in Java views is described in <<../java/routing-java-defining#, `Defining Routes [in Java]`>>.

The glue for mixing views is the `@vaadin/flow-frontend` module which allows lazy initialization of Flow and navigation to server views.

The server-side Java Component API (Flow) in Vaadin provides a client module that acts as a bridge between a client router and server routes.
It is also possible to integrate server-side Vaadin with any JavaScript-based routing solution.

The Flow client is distributed as a part of the link:https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.vaadin/vaadin/[`com.vaadin:vaadin`^] Maven artifact.
It is automatically included into any Vaadin application and can be imported into any TypeScript file as `import {Flow} from '@vaadin/flow-frontend';`.

=== Using the Client

First, you have to import the module, and then you have to create the `Flow` instance.

At this point, it is needed to specify the location to the Flow generated file with the imports for Java views, typically `/target/frontend/generated-flow-imports.js` in a Vaadin maven project.

Notice that the `import()` function should be used to lazy load Flow dependencies the first time the user navigates to a server-side view.

[source, typescript]
----
import {Flow} from '@vaadin/flow-frontend';
const flow = new Flow({
  imports: () => import('../target/frontend/generated-flow-imports')
});
----

Finally, make Vaadin Router pass all unmatched paths to Flow server by adding `...serverSideRoutes` at the end of the router configuration block:

[source, typescript]
----
import {Router} from '@vaadin/router';
import {Flow} from '@vaadin/flow-frontend';

const {serverSideRoutes} = new Flow({
  imports: () => import('../target/frontend/generated-flow-imports')
});

export const router = new Router(document.querySelector('#outlet'));
router.setRoutes([
  {
    path: 'categories',
    component: 'app-categories',
    action: async () => { await import('./views/app-categories-view'); }
  },
  // for server-side, the next magic line sends all unmatched routes:
  ...serverSideRoutes // IMPORTANT: this must be the last entry in the array
]);
