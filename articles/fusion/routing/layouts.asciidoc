== Router Layouts

When using client-side routing it is possible to compose the page layout without any server intervention, so as the initial application page also known as <<../advanced/modifying-the-bootstrap-page#application-shell,Application Shell>> can be shown when in offline mode.

Vaadin Router allows to group related routes together under a common parent by using the `children` property during the configuration:

[source, typescript]
----
router.setRoutes([
  {
    path: '',
    component: 'app-layout',
    action: async () => { await import('./views/app-layout-view'); },
    children: [
      {
        path: 'help',
        component: 'app-help',
        action: async () => { await import('./views/app-help-view'); }
      },
      {
        path: 'categories',
        component: 'app-categories',
        action: async () => { await import('./views/app-categories-view'); }
      }
    ]
  }
]);
