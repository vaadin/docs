= Configuring a Fusion Application

You may need to customize the configuration of a Fusion application both for your development environment and execution.


[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@15"]
== Prerequisites

Fusion applications have the following prerequisites.
To write the bootstrapping code for an application or create views in TypeScript, make sure that:

 - <<starting#, Client-side bootstrapping>> is enabled.

 - The `index.html` page template and the `index.ts` entry point exist in the `frontend/` folder.

If you are starting with a starter application, they should already have been taken care of.

After that, any `.ts` file imported from `index.ts` (statically or dynamically) is going to be built as a part of the application.


== Hot Reload in Development Mode

When running the application in development mode, all modifications in `frontend` folder are compiled automatically.
Refreshing the browser is enough to see the updates in the application.

.Server restart is required
[NOTE]
When adding `index.ts` or `index.html`, the application server needs to be restarted to update the entry point and the bootstrap template.


== Configuring the TypeScript Compiler

TypeScript compiler requires a `tsconfig.json` file, `vaadin-maven-plugin` generates one in case there is no `tsconfig.json` in the project root.
The default configuration looks similar to the following:

.Default `tsconfig.json`
[source,json]
