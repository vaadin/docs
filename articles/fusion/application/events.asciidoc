= Handling Events

Events are dispatched in the browser when the user interacts with the interface.
Web applications can react on those interactions by handling events, for example, running some code when the user clicks a certain button.

To handle events, applications register event listener methods for specific event types, which indicate the type of interaction, such as `click`, on the interactive targets (typically interface elements).

== Declarative Event Listeners

For registering event listeners in Fusion application views, we recommend declaring them in your Lit templates using `@event` bindings with view class methods.
In the example below, the view registers an event listener for the `sayHello`
method to show the notification when the user clicks the button.

You can also add event listeners programmatically when needed, as well as dispatch and listen for custom events.
See link:https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/events[the LitElementâ€™s
Events Guide] for those use cases and examples.

== Events Available for Handling

The most often used events in Fusion applications fall onto two major categories: built-in and custom ones.

The built-in events, such as `click`, `input`, and `change`, are dispatched by the browser itself, and are typically available on every element.
The comprehensive lists of events available for all HTML elements could be found in the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element[Element API] and the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement#events[HTMLElement API]
References.

Web components, and Vaadin components as such, also dispatch custom events in addition.
See the HTML API references for those on the link:https://vaadin.com/components[Vaadin components] web pages.

== Event Object

The listener methods receive the event object as the first argument.
The event objects provide some useful properties and methods, such as:

- `event.type` the event type string, for example, `click`
- `event.target` the reference to the target (element) of the interaction
- `event.detail` in `CustomEvent` types, which is often used by web components for event-specific data, for example, `event.detail.value` is often used to propagate the new value in `property-changed` events and such
- `event.preventDefault()` to cancel the built-in handling of the particular event, for example, to prevent the browser from navigating when the user clicks a link, after that click was already handled in the listener

In the example below, the `event.detail.value` is used in the
`value-changed` event handler to extract the edited `value` property of the
`<vaadin-text-field>` element:

== Related Topics

Some common use cases of event handling are also explained in other articles.

=== User Input in Forms

When making forms in Fusion applications, consider using the <<../forms/#,the Form Binder>>.
With the form binder, you could avoid writing code for handling change events in the form, since the binder automatically tracks those changes.

=== View Properties

To maintain a consistent state within a view, it is generally a good idea to
use declarative template bindings (`.property=${this.value}`) and avoid the
imperative `element.property = this.value;` code style in event listeners.
See the LitElement basics article for the binding syntax.

=== Application State

In addition, often developers need to maintain the state consistent across the entire web application.
To achieve that, consider using <<state-management#, State Management>>.
