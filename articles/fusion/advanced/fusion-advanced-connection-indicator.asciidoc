= The Connection Indicator

The _connection indicator_ informs the user about the server connection status,
and indicates the loading progress in case if network requests take some time.

It shows connection status messages when the state of the server connection
state changes, for example, if the userâ€™s device goes offline and back online.
Starting an application offline also triggers the connection status message.

Also, to inform the user that loading is in progress and that the _UI_ is unresponsive, 
a _loading bar_ is displayed. A longer loading time might be due to, 
for example, bad network conditions. 
Vaadin automatically displays a loading indicator after a configurable delay when a server request starts, and hides it after the response processing has ended.

*With default theme applied*, the connection indicator is at the top of
the viewport. The connection status message shows after trigger for a short
configurable duration. If the connection is available, the indicator containing
then message then disappears, otherwise the indicator remains collapsed and
expandable on hover.

You can change messages text, delays, or customize the looks of the indicator.

Vaadin automatically creates `vaadin-connection-indicator` and adds it to
the body. The theming targets the loading bar with the `.v-loading-indicator`
selector, and the connection status message with the `.v-status-message`, both
are regular children inside the `vaadin-connection-indicator`. You can also
toggle the default theming off for using custom styling of the indicator.
