= Composing a Fusion View Out of Components

Vaadin Fusion uses the https://lit.dev/[Lit] library for building views.
Views are constructed using components from the Vaadin component library, HTML, and CSS.

This chapter covers:

* Vaadin component basics.
* Building reactive UIs.
* Lit basics.
* Constructing a view with Vaadin components and Lit.

== Vaadin UI Components

Vaadin includes over <<{articles}/ds/overview#,40 UI components>> to help you build apps faster.
By using ready-made building blocks, you are able to focus more of your time on building end-user functionality.

Vaadin components are custom HTML elements that are registered with the browser.
They are based on W3C web component standards.
Once loaded, you can use the custom HTML tags like any other HTML.

The components have light and dark themes, and you can further customize them through CSS variables to fit your brand.

== An Introduction to Lit

Lit is a lightweight and performant library for building reactive components with declarative templates.

If you are not familiar with Lit, please read the <<../application/lit#, Lit basics article>>.

== The Contact List View

The first view is the Contact list view.
This view lists all the contacts in the system.
Users can search, add, edit, and delete contacts on this view.

You initially focus only on the list view.
You add the layout containing the header and sidebar later in the Navigation and parent layouts chapter.

In this and the next chapter, you create the needed layouts and components for the view.
Then, in the chapter that follows, you create an endpoint for populating the view with data.

For this view, you need the following Vaadin components:

* <<{articles}/ds/components/text-field#,Text Field>>
* <<{articles}/ds/components/button#,Button>>
* <<{articles}/ds/components/grid#,Grid>>

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.ProductName = NO -->]

== Importing Vaadin Components

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.ProductName = YES -->]

Before you can use Vaadin components, you need to import them.
Importing the components registers the custom HTML elements with the browser.
It also helps the build tool to understand what components are being used, so it can optimize the resulting JavaScript to only include the needed components.

Add the following imports to the top of `frontend/views/list/list-view.ts`:

.`list-view.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
import "@vaadin/vaadin-text-field";
import "@vaadin/vaadin-button";
import "@vaadin/vaadin-grid";
import "@vaadin/vaadin-grid/src/vaadin-grid-column";
----

== Defining the View Template

Now that the components are imported, you can use them in the template.
The template is defined in the `render()` method.

Replace the contents of the render method with the following:

.`list-view.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
render() {
 return html`
   <div class="toolbar gap-s">
     <vaadin-text-field
       placeholder="Filter by name"
       clear-button-visible
     ></vaadin-text-field>
     <vaadin-button>Add Contact</vaadin-button>
   </div>
   <div class="content flex se-m h-full">
     <vaadin-grid class="grid h-full">
       <vaadin-grid-column path="firstName" auto-width>
         </vaadin-grid-column>
       <vaadin-grid-column path="lastName" auto-width>
         </vaadin-grid-column>
       <vaadin-grid-column path="email" auto-width>
         </vaadin-grid-column>
       <vaadin-grid-column
         path="status.name"
         header="Status"
         auto-width
       ></vaadin-grid-column>
       <vaadin-grid-column
         path="company.name"
         auto-width
         header="Company"
       ></vaadin-grid-column>
     </vaadin-grid>
   </div>
 `;
}
----

- The text field is configured to show a placeholder text and a clear button.
- Grid columns map to properties on an object based on the `path` attribute.
By default, the header name is derived from the path.
You can override it with `header`, for instance when binding to a nested object's path.
- The Vaadin Lumo theme comes with a set of CSS utility classes to simplify layouts and styling.
Instead of having to write your own CSS for common tasks like adding margins, padding, setting sizes, and defining layouts, you can use utility CSS classes like `flex` and `h-full`.
You can browse all the classes in `node_modules/lumo-css-framework/all-classes.css`. 
The classes follow https://tailwindcss.com/docs[Tailwind CSS] classnames.

== Adding CSS Classes to The View Component

Until now, you have only added CSS class names to HTML elements within the template.
You also need to add classes to the `<list-view>` element itself.
The easiest way to do this is to use the `connectedCallback` lifecycle callback.

Add the following method to the `ListView` class:

.`list-view.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
connectedCallback() {
 super.connectedCallback();
 this.classList.add(
    'box-border',
    'flex',
    'flex-col',
    'p-m',
    'spacing-b-s',
    'w-full',
    'h-full'
  );
}
----

Here, you apply the following styles:

- `box-border` - include padding in the height and width.
- `flex`, `flex-col` - a vertical flex layout.
- `p-m` - medium padding.
- `spacing-b-s` - spacing bottom, small.
- `w-full`, `h-full` - full width and height.

It is important to remember to call `super.connectedCallback()` whenever you override `connectedCallback()` to ensure that Lit initializes the component.
Save your view file and you should now see this in your browser (start the development server with `mvn` if you don't have it running):
