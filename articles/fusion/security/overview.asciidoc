See the <<../../flow/security/flow-overview#, corresponding article for the Java API>>.

Fusion supports role-based access control at endpoint level.
You specify the access rules as annotations for the endpoint class or its individual methods.

.MyEndpoint.java
----
@Endpoint
@DenyAll
public class MyEndpoint {
  @PermitAll
  public void permittedToAllMethod() {
    // Any authenticated user can access
  }

  @RolesAllowed("ROLE_ADMIN")
  public void permittedToRoleMethod() {
    // Only users with admin role can access
  }
}
----

Fusion handles authentication with a back-end service, such as Spring Security, LDAP, or an SQL database.
To use such a service, you need to configure a security adapter.
