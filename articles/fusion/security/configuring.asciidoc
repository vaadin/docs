= Configuring Security

When developing server-side views, endpoint access control is implemented using regular Java approaches: servlet-container-based security, third-party libraries, or session-based solutions.

This article describes all the pieces needed for securing client-centric applications.

== How to Secure Server-Side Endpoints

The first step is to configure authorization of each endpoint that the application exposes.

=== Default Security Options

Consider the basic Vaadin endpoint defined in the following class:

.CounterEndpoint.java
[source,java]
----
@Endpoint
@PermitAll
public class CounterEndpoint {
    public int addOne(int number) {
        return number + 1;
    }
}
----

Vaadin access-control features are enabled by default for any endpoint method:
if not specified in Java code explicitly, a `Principal` object must be present in the request before invoking an endpoint method.
The `HttpServletRequest#getUserPrincipal()` Java API is used for the check.

At this point, the servlet container or the application needs to be configured appropriately to handle user authentication.
This is described in the <<spring-login#,Adding a Login Form with Spring Security>> and <<{articles}/flow/advanced/servlet-container-authentication#,Configuring Servlet-Container Authentication>> articles.

== Other Security Options

By default, all anonymous and authenticated requests are denied.
In order to change the default behavior, a security Java annotation should be placed either on the endpoint class or on the endpoint method.
The following annotations are available:

* [classname]#@PermitAll#
Allows any authenticated user to call a method via the request.
* [classname]#@RolesAllowed#
Grants access to users having the roles specified in the annotation value. Roles are covered in the <<permissions,next section>>.
* [classname]#@DenyAll#
Disallows anyone from calling the method via the request. The default.
* `@AnonymousAllowed`
Permits anyone to call the method via the request without authorization.

A security annotation that is placed on a class is applied to any public method of this class that has no security annotations.
If the method has security annotations, any class-level annotation is discarded and only method-level ones are applied.

If there are multiple annotations specified on some entity, the following rules are applied:

- `DenyAll` overrides other annotations
- `AnonymousAllowed` overrides `RolesAllowed` and `PermitAll`
- `RolesAllowed` overrides `PermitAll`

Example:

.MyEndpoint.java
[source,java]
----
@Endpoint
@PermitAll
public class MyEndpoint {

  @DenyAll
  public void deniedMethod() {
    // Not possible to call by any request. Since there
    // is a `@PermitAll` annotation on the
    // class, we specify this one on a method to override
    // the class one.
  }

  @AnonymousAllowed
  public void anonymousMethod() {
    // Possible to call by any request (even without
    // authorization) since method level annotation
    // overrides class-level one
  }

  public void permittedToAllMethod() {
    // Permitted to all authenticated users as per the
    // class annotation.
  }

  @RolesAllowed("ROLE_ADMIN")
  public void permittedToRoleMethod() {
    // Permitted to all authenticated users having the
    // role ROLE_ADMIN.
  }
}
----

== Defining User Permissions[[permissions]]

As mentioned in the previous section, every user can have roles and this may affect their ability to access some endpoint methods.
This section explains how to specify these for each user.

Vaadin endpoints checks the existence of roles by using the `HttpServletRequest#isUserInRole(String)` Java API.

Once the servlet container has been configured to handle user authentication, when the server receives a request for the secured endpoint, the user and its roles are checked; if everything is OK, the method is executed.

== Accessing User Information in an Endpoint Method

When access to the `UserPrincipal` is required in an endpoint, call the `VaadinRequest.getCurrent()` method to access the `HttpServletRequest` API.

.EchoEndpoint.java
[source,java]
----
@Endpoint
public class EchoEndpoint {
    public String saySomething(String message) {
        return VaadinRequest.getCurrent().getUserPrincipal().getName() + " says: " + message;
    }
}
----

.frontend/index.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { EchoEndpoint } from 'Frontend/generated/EchoEndpoint';

EchoEndpoint
    .saySomething("It's snowing in Turku")
    .then(response => console.log(response));
----

== Checking Authentication on the Client Side

If it is required to know, on the client side, whether a user is authenticated, please read the <<authentication#, Checking Authentication>> article.

== CSRF Protection of Vaadin Endpoints

Vaadin endpoints are protected from CSRF attacks using the same approach as the rest of Vaadin. See <<{articles}/flow/security/vulnerabilities#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-xsrf, Cross-Site Request Forgery>> in the security guide for more details.
