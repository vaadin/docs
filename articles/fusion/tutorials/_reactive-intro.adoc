== An Introduction to Building Reactive UIs

Building reactive views and components may take some getting used to, if your background is in Vaadin Flow, jQuery, or another imperative model. 
Reactive views have fewer moving parts and because of this they are easier to understand and debug. 
In reactive UI programming, your UI is a function of the component's state. 
Whenever the state changes, the UI is re-rendered. 

In imperative UI programming, there are two states: the data model and the UI. 
It is your responsibility as a developer to keep them in sync. 
In reactive programming, there is only one state: the data. 
The UI always reflects that state. 

.Imperative UI with Vaadin Flow
[source,java]
----
public class ImperativeView extends Div {
 H1 header = new H1();
 ListItem email = new ListItem();
 ListItem phone = new ListItem();
 
 public ImperativeView() {
   add(header, new UnorderedList(email, phone));
 }
 
 // Update UI when contact changes
 public void setContact(Contact contact) {
   header.setText(String.format("Details for %s %s",
     contact.getFirstName(),
     contact.getLastName()));
   email.setText("Email: " + contact.getEmail());
   phone.setText("Phone: " + contact.getPhone());
 }
}

When building a UI imperatively, you need to keep references to elements so you can update their values when the underlying state (the `Contact`) changes. 

.Reactive UI with Vaadin Fusion
[source,typescript]
----
export class ReactiveView extends View {
 @property({ type: Object })
 contact: Contact = {...};
 
 // Render is called automatically when contact changes
 render() {
   return html`
     <h1>Details for ${this.contact.firstName} ${this.contact.lastName}</h1>
     <ul>
       <li>Email: ${this.contact.email}</li>
       <li>Phone: ${this.contact.phone}</li>
     </ul>
   `;
 }
}
----

When building a UI reactively, you define a template using values from the state (`Contact`). 
Whenever the model changes, the template is automatically updated. 

.Avoid element references in reactive views
[TIP]
====
As a rule of thumb, you should not use `document.querySelector` or LitElement `@query` to get element reference in order to set values or properties imperatively. 
There is almost always a way to achieve the same with binding values through the template.
