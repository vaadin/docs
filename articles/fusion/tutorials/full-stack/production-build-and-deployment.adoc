= Production mode and cloud deployment to Heroku

In this last chapter, we prepare the CRM application for production and deploy it to Heroku. We have chosen to use Heroku because it's simple and comes with a free tier that does not require a credit card when signing up. The free tier also includes PostgreSQL support. 

NOTE: You can deploy Vaadin applications on any cloud provider or hosting service that supports Java. The project also contains a `Dockerfile` that you can use for container deployments. https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/cloud-deployment/[Learn more about deploying to different cloud providers.] 

In this chapter, we cover:

- Vaadin production builds.
- Creating a Heroku account. 
- Installing the Heroku CLI.
- Creating and deploying a Heroku app.

== Preparing the application for production
It's important to build a separate production-optimized version of the application before deploying it. In development mode, Vaadin has a live-reload widget, debug logging, and uses a quick, but unoptimized, frontend build that includes source maps for easy debugging. Unoptimized frontend bundles can contain several megabytes of JavaScript. 

The `pom.xml` build includes a `production` profile configuration that prepares an optimized build that's ready for production. 

=== Using a PostgreSQL database in production
During development, we have used an in-memory H2 database. It is convenient and works well for a single user. In production, we want to use something more robust. Heroku's free tier supports PostgreSQL, so let's configure our application to use that. 

First, add the PostgreSQL dependency in the production profile of `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml,highlight=4-9]
----
<profile>
 <id>production</id>
 <!-- Omitted -->
 <dependencies>
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
     <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
   </dependency>
 </dependencies>
</profile>
----

Next, configure how JPA should handle schema generation. Add the following two properties to the end of `application.properties`. 

.src/main/java/resources/application.properties
[source]
----
spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
----

WARNING: This setup recreates the database on every deployment. If you are working with actual data, you should use `ddl-auto=none` and instead use a database migration tool like https://www.liquibase.org/[Liquibase] or https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] so you can evolve the database schema without losing data. 

=== Building a production-optimized JAR
Build the application with the `production` profile: 

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package -Pproduction
----

This will build a production-optimized JAR file in the `target` folder. 

== Creating a Heroku account and installing Heroku CLI
Complete the following steps to create a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI. 

1. Go to https://signup.heroku.com/, create a new account, and verify your email.
2. Go to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli and follow the instructions for installing the CLI on your operating system.

== Deploying a Vaadin app to Heroku
Use the Heroku CLI to create and deploy your application. 

1. Log in: 
+
[source]
----
heroku login
----
2. Install the Heroku Java plugin:
+ 
[source]
----
heroku plugins:install java
----
3. Create a new app. Replace APPNAME with a name of your choice.  APPNAME will be part of the URL, like https://APPNAME.herokuapp.com, so choose a name that's unique and easy to remember. 
+ 
[source]
----
heroku create APPNAME
----
4. Enable the PostgreSQL plugin for the newly-created app:
+ 
[source]
----
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql -a APPNAME
----
5. Deploy the production-optimized JAR file you created in the previous section.
+
[source]
----
heroku deploy:jar target/fusioncrmtutorial-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -a APPNAME
----
6. Open the application in your browser.
+
[source]
----
heroku open
----
7. View the application logs, if anything goes wrong. 
+
[source]
----
heroku logs --tail
----

== Conclusion and next steps
Congratulations, you have now built a full-stack PWA and deployed it in the cloud! 

Did you like the tutorial? Did you find anything that didnâ€™t seem right? Reach out to me on Twitter https://twitter.com/marcushellberg[@marcushellberg]. 

Now that you have a running application, you can use it to experiment further or use it as a foundation for your next idea. 

Happy hacking, and ping us https://twitter.com/vaadin[@vaadin] on Twitter to show off the cool stuff you've built!
