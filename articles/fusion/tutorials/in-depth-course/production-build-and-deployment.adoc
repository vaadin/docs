= Production Mode and Cloud Deployment to Heroku

In this last chapter, you prepare the CRM application for production and deploy it to Heroku. 
The tutorial uses Heroku because it's simple and comes with a free tier that does not require a credit card when signing up. 
The free tier also includes PostgreSQL support.
