= Creating a Reusable Form Component for Editing Contacts

The list view now has a grid to display `Contact` objects. 
To complete the view, you need to create a form for editing contacts.

This chapter covers:

* Creating a new component.
* Importing and using a custom component. 

== Creating a New Component

Create a new file in the same directory as the list view: `frontend/views/list/contact-form.ts`.

Add the following content to the file:

.`contact-form.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
import { html } from 'lit';
import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js';
import { View } from '../view';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-text-field';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-combo-box';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-button';
 
@customElement('contact-form') 
export class ContactForm extends View { 
 render() {
   return html`
     <vaadin-text-field label="First name"></vaadin-text-field>
     <vaadin-text-field label="Last name"></vaadin-text-field>
     <vaadin-text-field label="Email"></vaadin-text-field>
     <vaadin-combo-box label="Status"></vaadin-combo-box>
     <vaadin-combo-box label="Company"> </vaadin-combo-box>
 
     <div class="spacing-e-s">
       <vaadin-button theme="primary">Save</vaadin-button>
       <vaadin-button theme="error">Delete</vaadin-button>
       <vaadin-button theme="tertiary">Cancel</vaadin-button>
     </div>
   `;
 }
}

As stated in the Introduction to Lit section, there are three main parts to defining a Lit component: 

1. Creating a class that extends from `LitElement`.
2. Defining the tag name and registering the element with `@customElement`.
3. Defining a template as a tagged `html` template literal as a return value of the `render()` method.

In this case, instead of directly extending `LitElement`, you use `View`. 
`View` turns off the Shadow DOM for easier app-wide theming and adds support for MobX state management that you need later on. 

The tag name in `@customElement` needs to include a dash (`-`). 
It's good practice to use the same name for the file and the tag name, `contact-form` in this case. 

The template uses three components from the Vaadin component set: text field, combo box and button. 
The buttons specify different theme variants using the `theme="variant"` attribute. 

== Using a Custom Component in Another View

You need to import the new `contact-form` component in `list-view` before using it. 

Add the following import at the end of the imports in `list-view.ts`:

.`list-view.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
import './contact-form';
----

Then, add the component to the template right after the `</vaadin-grid>` end tag. 

.`list-view.ts`
[source,html]
----
<contact-form class="flex flex-col spacing-b-s"></contact-form>
----

Here, you again use the Lumo utility CSS classes to turn the form into a flex container with spacing between components. 

As a last step, make the form wider with by adding the following CSS: 

.`frontend/views/list/list-view.css`
[source,css]
----
list-view contact-form {
 flex-shrink: 0;
 width: 25em;
}
----

The `themes` folder contains the CSS for the project. 
Be sure to scope your CSS selectors with the component name when using `View` as the base class. 
This ensures you don't accidentally apply styles to other components. 

Open your browser to localhost:8080, and you should see the following:

If your development server isn't running, start it with the `mvn` command from the command line. 

Now that you have the view ready, you can turn your focus to the backend and create an endpoint for fetching and persisting data to the server.
