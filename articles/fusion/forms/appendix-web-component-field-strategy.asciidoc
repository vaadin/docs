= Using Custom Web Components in a Form

While Vaadin components are supported out-of-the-box, the client-side <<overview#,Form binder>> can be configured to support any web component.
This article explains how to create a form with a custom `<my-text-field>` web component.

Using a custom web component in a form requires two steps:

1. creating a _field strategy_ that tells the form binder how to get and set the component `value` and other properties such as `required` and `errorMessage`.
2. creating a custom _binder_ subclass that associates the new custom field strategy with the custom web component tag.

== Example of a Web Component

Let us consider the following LitElement component for using in form binding.
Note that it does not expose properties like `required`, `invalid` and `errorMessage`, which is why the default field strategy that works for all Vaadin components would not work here.

== Defining a Field Strategy

The first step towards using a web component as a field is to define a field strategy.

You need to implement the `FieldStrategy` interface, as in the example below:

== Using the Field Strategy

Subclass the Binder class and override the `getFieldStrategy(element)` method to use a custom field strategy for any `my-text-field` components it finds in a form:

include::{root}/frontend/demo/fusion/forms/field-strategy/my-binder.ts[]

After that you can use `my-text-field` components in a form, provided that you use the extended `MyBinder` class to handle data binding in that form.
