Polymer support has been deprecated since Vaadin 18 (released in November 2020), in favor of faster and simpler <<{articles}/create-ui/templates#,Lit templates>>. The built-in support for Polymer templates has been removed and is only available for Prime and Ultimate customers via an addon. However, a free conversion tool is available to assist in converting Polymer templates to Lit.

Read more about setting up the commercial Polymer templates addon in the <<{articles}/upgrading/#polymer-templates,Upgrade Guide>>.
