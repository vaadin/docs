= User Interface Interaction

Some background jobs execute business processes in the background. The end user may see the result of the background job, but does not have to interact with the job directly. Scheduled jobs and event triggered jobs typically fall in this category.

Then there are jobs that need to interact with the user interface. For instance, the job may want to update a progress indicator while running, and notify the user when the job has completed, or an error has occurred. Furthermore, the user may want to be able to cancel a running job before it has completed. This page explains different options for allowing a user to interact with a background job, and vice versa.
