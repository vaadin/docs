= Strong Consistency

Strong consistency, or immediate consistency, means that the effects of an update are immediately observable across the entire system. For instance, if a user inserts a new record into the system, it should be visible to all other users as soon as the user has pressed the save button.

One way of achieving strong consistency is to use transactions. Modern databases support transactions out of the box. As a rule of thumb, you should use them whenever your business application reads or writes data. For more information about this, see the <<transactions#,Transactions>> documentation page.
