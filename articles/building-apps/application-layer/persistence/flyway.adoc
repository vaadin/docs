= Flyway

Whenever you store data in a relational database, you have to manage the database schema in some way. When the application is first installed, you have to create the entire database schema. When new features are deployed, you have to update the database schema. You may need to add new tables to the database. You may need to add new columns to existing tables. You may need to move data from one table to another one, and delete the old one. 

Some object-relational mapping tools, like Hibernate, can generate the initial schema for you. They may also be able to perform trivial updates to the schema, like creating new tables. In more complex cases, however, they are at a loss. Therefore, https://www.red-gate.com/products/flyway/community/[Flyway] is the recommended tool for managing database schemas in Vaadin applications.

[NOTE]
On this page, you'll learn enough about Flyway to get started using it in your Vaadin applications. Because Flyway has more features than presented here, you should also read the https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway[Flyway Documentation].

== Migrations

Flyway is based on the concept of _migrations_. A migration is a script that performs some changes on your database. Every migration is versioned. As you implement new features, you add new migrations to the project. Flyway keeps track of which migrations have been applied to the database in a separate table. This table includes a checksum of every migration script.

When Flyway runs, either at application startup, or as a part of your deployment pipeline, it compares the contents of this table with the migrations in your project. It then executes all the migrations that were missing, from the oldest to the newest version. If the database is new, Flyway creates its metadata table and executes all the migrations. 

Versioned migrations should not change after they have been applied. When Flyway runs, it recalculates the checksums of all the migrations in your project, and compares them with the checksums in the table. If there are any mismatches, it throws an exception and aborts.

In addition to versioned migrations, Flyway also supports repeatable migrations. These migrations can change after they have been applied, and are automatically re-applied after every change. Repeatable migrations are always applied after the versioned migrations.

== Writing Migrations

You can write migrations in multiple languages, including Java, but the most common one is ordinary SQL. The migration scripts should follow a specific naming pattern. Versioned migrations start with an uppercase `V`, followed by a version number, two underscores `\__`, a description, and the suffix `.sql`. For example, a migration could be named `V1__initial_schema_setup.sql`. 

Repeatable migrations start with an uppercase `R`, followed by two underscores `\__`, a description, and the suffix `.sql`. For example, a repeatable migration could be named `R__people_view.sql`. Repeatable migrations are sorted by their descriptions before they are applied. Take this into account if you need to apply one repeatable migration before another.

You should store your SQL scripts in the `src/main/resources/db/migration` directory of your project. If you are using a <<{articles}/building-apps/project-structure/multi-module#,multi-module project>>, you should store the migrations in the module that handles persistence. 

For information about writing migrations in other languages than SQL, see the https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway[Flyway Documentation].

== Migrating on Application Startup

Spring Boot has built-in support for Flyway. If the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` module is on the classpath, Flyway is automatically executed on application startup. 

Flyway has built-in support for clustered environments. If you launch multiple instances of the same application, pointing to the same database, Flyway makes sure that every migration is applied only once, in the correct order.

Unless you are using an in-memory database like H2, you have to add a database specific module to the classpath, in addition to the database's own JDBC driver. For example, use `org.flywaydb:flyway-database-postgresql` with PostgreSQL and `org.flywaydb:flyway-mysql` with MySQL.

[NOTE]
See the https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway/flyway-cli-and-api/supported-databases[Flyway Documentation] for a complete list of supported databases.

Spring Boot declares the modules in its parent POM, so you don't have to look up their versions. To use them, add them to your project POM-file, like this:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
        <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
        <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId> <!--1-->
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
        <artifactId>flyway-database-postgresql</artifactId> <!--2-->
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
<1> This is the JDBC-driver for PostgreSQL.
<2> This is the Flyway module for PostgreSQL.

By default, Flyway uses your application's primary data source to apply the migrations. This means that the database user that you use to connect to the database must have enough privileges to execute Data Definition Language (DDL) statements.

From a security point of view, it is better to have one database user for DDL, and another for Data Modification Language (DML) statements. The DDL user is used by Flyway to migrate the database schema. The DML user is used by the application to query and modify data without touching the schema itself.

To make Flyway use its own data source, set the `spring.flyway.[url,user,password]` configuration properties. If you leave out `spring.flyway.url`, Flyway uses the same URL as the application's primary data source.

For more information, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/data-initialization.html#howto.data-initialization.migration-tool.flyway[Spring Boot Documentation].

== Migrating with Maven

Sometimes, you may want to run the Flyway migrations as a separate build step. For example, you may not want to make the DDL user credentials available to the application itself for security reasons. Flyway has a Maven plugin that allows you to run the migration scripts as a part of your build chain.

To run Flyway with Maven, you should still keep the migration scripts in the same directory as you did when running Flyway at application startup. However, you should not add any Flyway dependencies to your project. Instead, you should add the Flyway plugin, like this:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
            <artifactId>flyway-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
                    <artifactId>flyway-database-postgresql</artifactId>
                    <version>${flyway.version}</version>
                </dependency>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
                    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
                    <version>${postgresql.version}</version>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

Note, that when you are adding dependencies to a Maven plugin, you have to specify their versions even if they have been declared in a parent POM. Spring Boot declares the versions of all its dependencies as properties, so you don't have to look them up yourself.

Now, whenever you want to run Flyway, execute the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ mvn -Dflyway.user=YOUR_DDL_USER -Dflyway.password=YOUR_DDL_USER_PASSWORD -Dflyway.url=YOUR_DB_URL flyway:migrate 
----
