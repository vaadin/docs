= Transactions



// ChatGPT: Database transactions are essential in business applications because they ensure data integrity, consistency, and reliability. They follow the "all-or-nothing" principle (atomicity), meaning either all operations in a transaction are completed or none, preventing partial updates and preserving data accuracy. Transactions also ensure that the database moves from one valid state to another (consistency), isolate operations to prevent conflicts in multi-user environments (isolation), and guarantee that committed data is permanent even in case of system failures (durability). These features make transactions critical for maintaining secure, efficient, and robust data management in business-critical systems.
