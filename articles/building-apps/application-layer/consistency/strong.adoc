= Strong Consistency

Strong consistency, or immediate consistency, means that the effects of an update are immediately observable across the entire system. For instance, if a user inserts a new record into the system, it should be visible to all other users as soon as the user has pressed the [guibutton]*Save* button.

One way of achieving strong consistency is to use transactions. Modern databases support transactions. As a general rule, you should use them whenever your business application reads or writes data. For more information about this, see the <<transactions#,Transactions>> documentation page.

// TODO Write something about monolits and self-contained systems here as well.
