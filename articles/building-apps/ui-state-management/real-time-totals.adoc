= Real-time Totals

In complex forms like shopping carts or order summaries, multiple values often depend on each other. A change in quantity affects the subtotal, which in turn affects the discount, tax, and finally the grand total.

With **Signals**, you can model these dependencies using **Computed signals**. Because computed signals can depend on other computed signals, you can build a chain of reactive calculations that update automatically whenever the base data changes.

== Chaining Computed Signals

The following example shows how to chain calculations for a shopping cart. Each step is a separate computed signal that depends on the previous one.

----

1. `subtotal` depends on the `cartItems` list.
2. `discount` depends on both `subtotal` and `discountCode`.
3. `total` depends on `subtotal`, `discount`, and `shipping`.

When a user changes a quantity in the cart, `cartItems` updates. This triggers `subtotal` to re-calculate, which then triggers `discount` and `total` in a cascade. You don't need to manually track which values need updating.

== Binding to the UI

Binding these chained calculations to the UI is just as simple as binding a single signal. You can bind signals to labels, visibility, or even dynamic child components.

* `totalLabel.bindText()`: Keeps the total display in sync with the `total` signal.
* `ComponentEffect.bindChildren()`: Dynamically renders components for each item in the `cartItems` list.

This declarative approach ensures that your UI always reflects the current state of your data, no matter how complex the underlying calculations are.
