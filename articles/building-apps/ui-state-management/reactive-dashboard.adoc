= Reactive Dashboard

A dashboard is a classic use case for reactive programming. It often requires displaying multiple live-updating metrics, real-time charts, and data tables that stay in sync without full-page reloads.

In this guide, you'll learn how to build a reactive dashboard using **Signals**. Signals simplify the implementation by providing a declarative way to bind your data (state) to UI components.

== Implementation Strategy

To build a reactive dashboard, we use a combination of layout components and signals:

* **`Dashboard` and `DashboardWidget`**: To create a responsive, grid-based layout for the dashboard elements.
* **`ValueSignal`**: To store individual metrics like "Current Users" or "Conversion Rate".
* **`SharedListSignal`**: To manage a collection of data, such as service health status.
* **`ComponentEffect`**: To bind these signals to UI components like `Span` for text or `Grid` for data tables.

== The Reactive Dashboard View

The following example demonstrates a dashboard with highlight cards for metrics and a grid for service health. The metrics and grid items are updated periodically to simulate real-time data flow.

== Key Concepts

=== Live Metrics with `ValueSignal`

Each highlight card is backed by a `ValueSignal<Double>`. When the signal's value changes, the UI automatically updates:

[source,java]
----
// Create a signal for the metric
private final WritableSignal<Double> currentUsersSignal = new ValueSignal<>(745.0);

// Bind it to the UI inside an effect
ComponentEffect.effect(this, () -> {
    valueSpan.setText(format.apply(currentUsersSignal.value()));
});
----

=== Real-time Grid with `SharedListSignal`

The service health grid uses a `SharedListSignal`. This allows the grid to update when items are added or removed, and also when individual items within the list are modified.

[source,java]
----
// Bind the grid to the list signal
ComponentEffect.bind(grid, serviceHealthSignal, (g, items) -> {
    g.setItems(items != null ? items : List.of());
});

// Update an individual item in the list
serviceHealthSignal.value().get(0).value(newHealthData);
----

Using `SharedListSignal` ensures that only the affected rows in the grid are refreshed when data changes, rather than reloading the entire dataset.

== Benefits of Signals for Dashboards

* **Declarative UI**: You define *what* should be displayed based on the state, and Vaadin handles *when* to update the UI.
* **Granular Updates**: Signals enable fine-grained updates, minimizing the amount of data sent to the browser.
* **Simplified Sync**: Multiple components can depend on the same signal, ensuring they always display consistent information without manual event coordination.
