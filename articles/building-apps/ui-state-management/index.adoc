= UI State Management

Managing the state of your user interface is a core part of building any web application. Whether it's tracking the current selection in a list, managing the multi-step progress of a wizard, or synchronizing data across different parts of the screen, how you handle state determines how easy your app is to build, test, and maintain.

In Vaadin, we believe the best way to manage UI state is through **Signals**. Signals offer a clear, reactive, and efficient model for state management that works consistently across both server-side (Flow) and client-side (Hilla) development.

This section provides instructive, opinionated guides on solving common state management challenges. Instead of exploring every technical detail, we focus on the "how" and "why" of our recommended patterns, showing you how to reach your goals using the specific features of Signals.

== Contents

* <<progressive-disclosure#, Progressive Disclosure>>: Reactively show and hide form fields based on user input.
* <<reactive-grid-filtering#, Reactive Grid Filtering>>: Use Computed signals to automatically filter data in a Grid.
* <<real-time-totals#, Real-time Totals>>: Chain computed signals to handle complex, multi-level UI calculations.

In this section, you'll learn how to achieve common UI goals:

* **Store and update state** simply and safely using `ValueSignal`.
* **Derive complex state** automatically from other values using `Computed` signals, eliminating manual synchronization.
* **Synchronize the UI and external systems** by reacting to state changes with `Effect`.
* **Handle collections and numbers** efficiently with specialized `ListSignal`, `MapSignal`, and `NumberSignal` types.
