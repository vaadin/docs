= Multi-Step Wizard

Complex forms are often easier for users to complete when broken down into smaller, logical steps. This pattern, known as a **wizard**, requires managing the current step, the data entered across all steps, and the validation logic that determines when a user can proceed.

Signals provide an elegant way to handle this multi-dimensional state. By combining navigation state and form data into a reactive graph, you can create a wizard that feels snappy and ensures data integrity.

== Implementation Strategy

To build a reactive wizard with Signals, follow these steps:

1.  **Define the Navigation State**: Use a `ValueSignal` to track the current step (typically an `Enum`).
2.  **Model the Form Data**: Create signals for each input field (or a single signal for a data object).
3.  **Implement Progressive Validation**: Use `Signal.computed()` to derive the validity of each step based on the form signals.
4.  **Bind Component Visibility**: Use `bindVisible()` to show only the layout corresponding to the current step.
5.  **Reactive Navigation**: Bind the `enabled` state of navigation buttons to your validation signals.

== Example: User Registration Wizard

The following example demonstrates a four-step registration wizard: Personal Info, Company Info, Plan Selection, and Review.

=== Key Highlights

*   **State Management**: `currentStep` is a `ValueSignal<WizardStep>` that acts as the single source of truth for the wizard's progress.
*   **Reactive Layouts**: Each step's `VerticalLayout` is bound to the `currentStep` signal using `bindVisible()`. This ensures only the active step is rendered.
*   **Validation**: `step1Valid` and `step2Valid` are computed signals. They automatically re-evaluate whenever any field signal in that step changes.
*   **Conditional Navigation**: The "Next" button uses `bindEnabled()` to check the validity of the *current* step. This prevents users from moving forward with invalid data.
*   **Summary View**: The final "Review" step uses a computed signal to create a string representation of all gathered data, ensuring it's always up-to-date.

== Summary

By using Signals for wizards, you eliminate the need for manual event listeners and complex conditional logic in your navigation handlers. The UI reactively updates based on the current state and the validity of the data, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable implementation of the multi-step pattern.
