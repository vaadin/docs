= Progressive Disclosure

Progressive disclosure is a technique where you only show information and actions that are relevant to the user's current context. This keeps your forms clean, reduces cognitive load, and guides the user through complex processes.

With **Signals**, implementing progressive disclosure is straightforward. You can bind the visibility of entire sections of your UI to the state of a signal. Vaadin automatically handles the showing and hiding of these sections whenever the signal value changes.

== Basic Conditional Visibility

The simplest form of progressive disclosure is showing a section based on a single condition, such as a checkbox.

In this example, we have a checkbox that asks if the user needs visa sponsorship. When checked, it reveals a section with additional fields.

1. `ValueSignal` tracks the state that drives visibility.
2. `bindValue` synchronizes the checkbox with the signal.
3. `bindVisible` automatically shows or hides the section based on the signal's value.

== Nested and Complex Conditions

You can also create more complex, nested conditions. For example, you might only want to show certain fields if a specific option is selected in a dropdown, and only if another condition is also met.

By using a lambda expression in `bindVisible()`, you can combine multiple signals or check for specific values. Because Signals are reactive, Vaadin automatically tracks these dependencies and re-evaluates the condition whenever any of the involved signals (`needsVisa` or `visaType`) change.

This approach is significantly cleaner than manually adding `ValueChangeListeners` to every component and toggling visibility in Java code. It keeps the "rules" for your UI visibility declared in one place, right where the components are defined, making the code easier to read and maintain.

== Reacting to State Changes

You can also react to state changes for other purposes, such as showing notifications or updating a summary area.

By binding the visibility and content of your display components to signals, you ensure the UI always stays in sync with your application state with minimal effort.
