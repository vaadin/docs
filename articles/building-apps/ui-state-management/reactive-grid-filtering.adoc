= Reactive Grid Filtering

A common requirement in business applications is a data grid with filters. Traditionally, this involves adding value change listeners to each filter component and manually updating the Grid's data provider.

With **Signals**, you can achieve this more elegantly using **Computed signals**. A computed signal automatically re-evaluates whenever any of its dependencies change, ensuring your UI stays in sync with minimal boilerplate.

== Filtering Data with Computed Signals

The core idea is to have signals for each filter input and a computed signal that derives the filtered list from these inputs.

1. `categorySignal`, `searchSignal`, and `inStockSignal` track the state of the filter inputs.
2. `filteredProducts` is a computed signal. Vaadin automatically detects that it depends on the three filter signals.
3. Whenever any of the filter signals change, `filteredProducts` is re-evaluated.

== Binding Signals to the UI

You can then bind the filter inputs to their respective signals and the computed list to the Grid.

* `bindValue()` synchronizes the input components with the signals.
* `ComponentEffect.bind()` keeps the Grid items updated whenever the `filteredProducts` signal emits a new list.

By using this reactive approach, you don't need to write any manual synchronization logic or event listeners. The relationships between your data and your UI are declared once, and Vaadin handles the rest.
