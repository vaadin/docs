= User Interface Interaction

Some background jobs execute business processes in the background. The end user may see the result of the job, but doesn't have to interact directly with it. Scheduled and event triggered jobs are typically in this category.

Then there are jobs that need to interact with the user interface. For instance, a job may want to update a progress indicator while running, and notify the user when it's finished or an error has occurred. Furthermore, the user may want to cancel a running job before it has completed. This page explains different options for allowing a user to interact with a background job, and vice versa.
