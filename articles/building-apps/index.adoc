= Building Applications the Vaadin Way

.Work in Progress
[IMPORTANT]
This section of the documentation is still being written. While the content is valuable, several parts are yet to be added.

Vaadin is a powerful platform for building real-world business applications. Like any versatile tool, it offers multiple ways to achieve results -- some leading to better outcomes than others.

Business applications often start small and evolve over time. While you can figure things out as you go, having a clear roadmap from the start makes the journey smoother. This section of the documentation introduces *The Vaadin Way* -- a structured, opinionated approach to building business applications with Vaadin.

The Vaadin Way isn't just about the user interface; it covers all key aspects of modern application development, including business logic, data persistence, integration with external systems, and deployment. It scales progressively, from small demos and personal projects to enterprise-grade solutions.

This section is divided into two main types of articles:

* *How-to Guides* -- Practical, step-by-step instructions for adding features and implementing common tasks.
* *Deep Dives* -- In-depth explorations of key concepts, best practices, and architectural decisions.

== How-to Guides

These hands-on guides show you how to implement specific features or complete essential tasks using Vaadin. If you started from a <<{articles}/getting-started/start#,Walking Skeleton>>, they show you how to "add muscles to the skeleton".

Rather than covering every possible aspect of a topic, the guides focus on the essentials and the most common use cases. They also highlight potential pitfalls and offer practical tips to avoid them.

Many guides include *mini-tutorials* at the end, allowing you to test concepts before applying them to your own applications.

If you're looking for a fast and effective way to become productive with Vaadin, start with the *How-to Guides*.


== Deep Dives

The Deep Dive articles take a broader and more conceptual approach to building business applications. Unlike the structured how-to guides, these articles explore the reasoning behind certain practices, provide in-depth knowledge, and offer insights, opinions, and alternative approaches.

Reading the Deep Dives isn't essential for getting started with Vaadin. If you're an experienced software developer, you may even disagree with some viewpoints -- and that's perfectly fine. However, if you want to master Vaadin and make the most of its capabilities, these articles are well worth exploring.
