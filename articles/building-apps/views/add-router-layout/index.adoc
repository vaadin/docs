= Add a Router Layout

Most business applications have interface elements that remain visible across different views, such as a navigation menu, header, or footer. Instead of duplicating these elements on every view, you can use a _router layout_.

A router layout ensures that the router *renders views inside a predefined layout*, reducing redundancy. The screenshot below illustrates an empty view rendered within a router layout:

The router layout includes a sidebar with the application name, a navigation menu, and a user menu. Views are displayed in the white area on the right.


== Nested Layouts

Layouts can be nested within other layouts. The following screenshot demonstrates a view inside a router layout, which itself is inside another router layout:

Nested layouts are useful for creating primary-detail interfaces, among other use cases.


== Flow and React

You can implement router layouts in both Vaadin Flow and React. Additionally, Flow views can be rendered inside React layouts, and vice versa.

.Consistency Matters
[TIP]
If most of your application is built with Flow, implement the router layouts in Flow. If it's primarily in React, use React for router layouts. This ensures code consistency.
