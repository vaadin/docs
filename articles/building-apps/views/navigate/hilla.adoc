= Navigation in Hilla

In this guide, you'll learn how to use `<NavLink>` component and `useNavigate` hook of `react-router` to navigate between views.


== Navigating Between Views Using Links

The `<NavLink>` component from `react-router` renders a clickable link for navigation. In HTML, it corresponds to an anchor (`<a>`) element.

[TIP]
Links are preferable to programmatic navigation because they *improve accessibility*. They also allow users to open links in new browser tabs.


For example, to create a link to a view located at `/some-view`, you can use the following code:

[source,tsx]
----
import { NavLink } from 'react-router';

<NavLink to="/some-view">Some View</NavLink>
----

This code creates a clickable link labeled "Some View" that navigates to the `/some-view` route when clicked.


== Programmatic Navigation

In some scenarios, you may need to navigate between views programmatically, such as after a form submission or in response to user interactions. For this you can use the `useNavigate` hook of `react-router` to achieve this.

Here's an example of how to use `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation:

[source,tsx]
----
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router';

function MyComponent() {
const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate('/target-view');
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Go to Target View
    </button>
  );
}
----

In the above example, clicking the button navigates the user to `/target-view`.


== Flow Views

To navigate from a Hilla view to a Flow view that is implemented in Java, the same principles apply. You can use the `NavLink` component or the `useNavigate` hook to navigate to the Flow view.
