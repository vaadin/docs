= Navigate to a View

You can navigate to a view either programmatically through an API, by clicking a link, or by changing the URL of the browser.

In a Vaadin application, navigation is handled by a _router_. The router takes care of rendering the correct view (i.e. the route target) and keeping the URL in sync. If the view accepts parameters, the router also extracts them from the URL and passes them on to the view.

Flow and Hilla views are handled by the same router. You can navigate to a Flow view from a Hilla view, and vice versa. 

The following guides teach you how to navigate between views in Vaadin:
