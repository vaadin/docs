= Add a Navigation Menu
:toclevels: 2


This guide teaches you how to add a navigation menu to a router layout in Vaadin. It is a continuation of the <<add-router-layout#,Add a Router Layout>> guide.

.Copy-Paste into Your Project
[TIP]
====
If you want to quickly try out a navigation menu, you can copy-paste the following code into your router layout:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/buildingapps/routerlayout/MainLayout.java[tags=navimenu,indent=0]
----

Expand the code for a complete implementation of a router layout with a navigation menu. For more detailed instructions on how to use build a navigation menu, continue reading below.

== Creating a Navigation Menu

You typically build a navigation menu in Vaadin using the Side Navigation components, which provide a vertical list of navigation links with support for collapsible, nested sections. This guide only covers the very basics of building a navigation menu. For more detailed information, see the <</components/side-nav#,Side Navigation>> documentation.

Start by creating an instance of [classname]`SideNav` to act as the container for the navigation items:

[source,java]
----
private SideNav createSideNav() {
    SideNav sideNav = new SideNav();
    // Add navigation items here
    return sideNav;
}
----

For every item in the navigation menu, create an instance of [classname]`SideNavItem`, and add it to the [classname]`SideNav` instance. Each item represents a link to a view in your application. You can create a simple navigation item like this:

[source,java]
----
SideNavItem homeItem = new SideNavItem("Home", HomeView.class);
sideNav.addItem(homeItem);
----

Now, whenever the user clicks on the item, the router navigates to the specified view. Furthermore, the item will be highlighted when the user is on that view.


=== Highlighting Nested Views

By default, a [classname]`SideNavItem` is highlighted only when the user is on the exact path of the view. That means that if the view has e.g. a URL parameter, or acts as a parent layout for another view, the item is not highlighted.

For example, an item with the path `/customers` has the following behavior:

* `/customers` -- item is highlighted
* `/customers/123` -- item is *not* highlighted
* `/customers/123/edit` -- item is *not* highlighted


To highlight the item for all paths that start with the view's path, use the [methodname]`SideNavItem.setMatchNested()` method:

[source,java]
----
SideNavItem customersItem = new SideNavItem("Customers", CustomersView.class);
customersItem.setMatchNested(true); 
// Now matches /customers, /customers/123, /customers/123/edit, etc.
sideNav.addItem(customersItem);
----


== Getting the Menu Items Dynamically

If your views have <<add-view#navigation-menu-item,navigation menu items>> defined using the [annotationname]`@Menu` annotation, you can build the menu dynamically.

The `MenuConfiguration.getMenuEntries()` method returns a list of all menu entries defined in the application. You can iterate over these entries and create corresponding [classname]`SideNavItem` instances for each entry:

[source,java]
----
private SideNav createSideNav() {
    var nav = new SideNav();
    MenuConfiguration.getMenuEntries()
            .forEach(entry -> nav.addItem(
                new SideNavItem(
                    entry.title(), 
                    entry.path()
                )
            ));
    return nav;
}
----

For technical details, see the <</flow/routing/menu-configuration#,Menu Configuration>> reference guide.


== Icons in the Menu

You often want to have icons in your navigation menu to improve usability and visual appeal. The `@Menu` annotation has an `icon` attribute, but it's an ordinary string. Therefore, you need to decide how to interpret that string in your menu implementation.

For example, if you use <</components/icons#,Vaadin Icons>>, you can create an icon for a menu item like this:

[source,java]
----
// Annotation on view:
@Menu(title = "Dashboard", icon = "vaadin:dashboard")

// In the menu building code:
item.setPrefixComponent(new Icon(menuEntry.icon()));
----

If you're using SVG icons, you can do this instead:

[source,java]
----
// Annotation on view:
@Menu(title = "Dashboard", icon = "icons/dashboard.svg")

// In the menu building code:
item.setPrefixComponent(new SvgIcon(menuEntry.icon()));
----
