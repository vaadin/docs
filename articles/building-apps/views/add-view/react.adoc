= React Views

In this guide, you'll learn how to create and name views in React, assign multiple routes to a single view, and organize views into Java packages. To reinforce your learning, a hands-on mini-tutorial at the end helps you apply these concepts in a real Vaadin application.


== Creating Views

Hilla views are React components that are returned by the default exported function defined in a TSX file:

[source,tsx]
.hello.tsx
----
export default function HelloView() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
----

The default way for creating routes for the views in Hilla is based on the file system structure. The _File-based Router_ automatically determines the route for a view based on:

1. where the respective file for a view is located, relative to the `src/main/frontend/views` directory, and

2. how the respective file for a view is named.

For example, if the `hello.tsx` file is located directly under `src/main/frontend/views`, then the route for `HelloView` component (default export from this file) is `/hello`, which means the file name `hello.tsx` without the `.tsx`. If the application is running from the root context, users would be able to access this view by navigating to `\https://example.com/hello`. Moreover, moving this file under `src/main/frontend/views/greeting` directory changes the route to `/greeting/hello`, so the users can access this view by navigating to `\https://example.com/greeting/hello`.

Likewise, naming the view file as `hello-world.tsx` or `HelloWorld.tsx` results in determining the route as `/hello-world` or `/HelloWorld`.

To avoid repeating the `src/main/frontend/views` throughout this guide, `views` used an alias to refer to this directory.

If a view is supposed to target the root route, the file should be named as `@index.tsx` and located directly under the `views` directory:

[source,tsx]
.@index.tsx
----
export default function HomeView() {
    return <h1>Home</h1>;
}
----

Then, the route for the above component is `/`, and if the application is running from the root context, users can access this view by navigating to `\https://example.com/`.

== View Naming

React only recognizes an exported function as a component, if the function name starts with an uppercase letter. For example, the following component is recognized as a valid React component:

[source,tsx]
.customers.tsx
----
export default function CustomersView() {
    return <h1>Customers</h1>;
}
----

Defining the function name as `customersView` or `customerList` does not result in a compile or runtime error, but is not recognized as a React component either.

The File-based Router also uses the React component's name for creating the default automatic title for the view. For example, the title for the `CustomersView` component is `Customers`, and the title for the `HelloWorldView` component is `Hello World`. This automatically determined title is used when creating the navigation menu based on utilities from the File-based Router API.

The details about the automatic title and the navigation menu are covered in more detail in the <<../navigate#,Navigate to a View>> guide.


== Route Aliases

In Hilla, there is no shortcut for creating multiple routes that target the same view. However, you can create a new view file that exports a component that returns the target component. You can place this alias component in any directory to create desired route alias. For example, the following view targets the root route (`/`):

[source,tsx]
.@index.tsx
----
export default function RootView() {
    return <h1>Home</h1>;
}
----

Now to have the same view accessible via `/home` and `/main`, you can create two additional view files:

[source,tsx]
.home.tsx
----
export default function HomeView() {
    return RootView();
}
----

and

[source,tsx]
.main.tsx
----
export default function MainView() {
    return RootView();
}
----
