= Add a Flow View

Flow views are Java classes that are annotated with [annotationname]`@Route` and extend [classname]`com.vaadin.flow.component.Component` -- or any of its subclasses. The default parameter of the [annotationname]`@Route` annotation is the path of the view. 

For example, you can define the [classname]`HelloWorld` component as the root view like this:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class HelloWorld extends Div {
    public HelloWorld() {
        setText("Hello world");
    }
}
----

If the application is running from the root context, users would be able to access this view by navigating to `\https://example.com`.

Likewise, you can define the [classname]`CustomerListView` component as the target for the `/customer/list` route:

[source,java]
----
@Route("customer/list")
public class CustomerListView extends Main {
    public CustomerListView() {
        //...
    }
}
----

Users would be able to access this view by navigating to `\https://example.com/customers`.

[NOTE]
Don't include a leading `/` when you specify the path of a view.

Navigation between views is covered in more detail in the <<../navigate#,Navigate to a View>> guide.


== View Naming

If you do not specify a default parameter for [annotationname]`@Route`, the path is derived from the name of the view. The derived name is the class name in lower case, with the `View` suffix removed if there is one. Also, [classname]`MainView` and [classname]`Main` are mapped to root. 

For example:

* [classname]`MyEditor` becomes `"myeditor"`
* [classname]`PersonView` becomes `"person"`
* [classname]`MainView` becomes `""`

If you specify the path explicitly, you can name your views any way you like.


== Route Aliases

You can create multiple routes that target the same view. You do this with the `@RouteAlias` annotation.

For example, you can map `\https://example.com`, `\https://example.com/home`, and `\https://example.com/main` to [classname]`HomeView` like this:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
@RouteAlias("home")
@RouteAlias("main")
public class HomeView extends Div {
    public HomeView() {
        //...
    }
}
----

Whenever you use route aliases, you have to create a primary route by using the [annotationname]`@Route` annotation. Only adding [annotationname]`@RouteAlias` to a view does not work.


== Package Naming

The recommended naming convention for Java packages containing views is [packagename]`[feature].ui.view`, where `[feature]` is the name of the full-stack feature that the view belongs to.

If the view consists of a single class only, you can store it directly in the `ui.view` package, like this:

[source]
----
com.example.application
└── crm <1>
    └── ui
        └── view
            ├── CustomerOnboardingView.java <2>
            ├── CustomerListView.java
            └── CUstomerDetailsView.java
----
<1> The example feature is "customer relationship management".
<2> All the views are in the same `view.ui` package.

If the view consists of more than one class, consider creating a separate package for it, like this:

[source]
----
com.example.application
└── crm
    └── ui
        └── view
            ├── onboarding
            │   ├── CustomerOnboardingView.java <1>
            │   └── ...
            ├── CustomerListView.java <2>
            └── CustomerDetailsView.java
----
<1> The onboarding view consists of multiple classes and has its own package.
<2> The other views remain in the `view.ui` package.

If you don't know whether your new view is going to be small or large, start by putting it in the `ui.view` package. You can always refactor it into its own package later.
