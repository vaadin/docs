= Use Route Parameters

Route parameters are variable URL segments. They are appended to the route path and used to pass extra information to a view.

For example, if the application has a `greet` route that accepts a string parameter, then users can call the route with the URL `/greet/<some-string>`. The following URLs would all call the same route:

* `/greet/John`
* `/greet/Jane`
* `/greet/World`
* and so on...

The `John`, `Jane`, and `World` strings are route parameter values that the `greet` route can use to respond to requests.

Static routes always take precedence over route parameters. For example, if the application has a `customer` route that accepts a string parameter, and a `customer/list` route, the URLs would be routed as follows:

* `/customer/cu1234` calls the `customer` route with `"cu1234"` as the parameter value
* `/customer/details` calls the `customer` route with `"details"` as the parameter value
* `/customer/list` calls the `customer/list` route
* `/customer` returns a `404 Not Found` error, unless the string parameter of the `customer` route has been declared optional

You can use route parameters in both Flow views and React views. The following guides show you how:
