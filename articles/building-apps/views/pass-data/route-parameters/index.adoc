= Route Parameters

Route parameters are dynamic segments in a URL that allow extra information to be passed to a view. They are appended to the route path and can be used to personalize responses or modify application behavior.

For example, if an application has a `greet` route that accepts a string parameter, users can call it with URLs like:

* `/greet/John`
* `/greet/Jane`
* `/greet/World`

Here, `"John"`, `"Jane"`, and `"World"` are parameter values that the `greet` route can use to generate a response.


== Route Parameters vs Static Routes

Static routes always take precedence over dynamic ones. For instance, consider an application with both a `customer` route (which accepts a string parameter), and a `customer/list` route:

* `/customer/cu1234` -> Calls the `customer` route with `"cu1234"` as the parameter value.
* `/customer/details` -> Calls the `customer` route with `"details"` as the parameter value.
* `/customer/list` -> Calls the dedicated `customer/list` route.
* `/customer` -> Returns a `404 Not Found` error, unless the parameter is explicitly declared optional.

== Using Route Parameters in Your Application

You can use route parameters in both Flow and Hilla views. The following guides show you how to implement them:
