= Pass Data to a View

The recommended way to pass data between views in a Vaadin application is through *URL parameters*. This approach enables _deep linking_, allowing users to navigate directly to a specific page or piece of content using a URL. With deep linking, users can bookmark key sections for quick access, share links with colleagues, and seamlessly navigate back using the browser's history and back button.

== Types of URL Parameters

Vaadin supports two types of URL parameters:

* *Route parameters* -- Part of the URL path, used to identify a specific view or content, such as a particular entity or tab.
* *Query parameters* -- Key-value pairs appended to the URL, ideal for storing UI state, like a grid's sort order or a search field's value.

[TIP]
Use *route parameters* when navigation depends on the structure of the URL, such as `/customer/123` to view customer details.

[TIP]
Use *query parameters* for storing state that affects a view's behavior, such as `/orders?sort=date&filter=shipped`.

The following guides explore different ways to pass data between views:

* Route-based navigation: <<route-parameters#,Route Parameters>> and <<route-templates#,Route Templates>>
