= Add a View
:toclevels: 2

In this guide, you'll learn how to create and name views in Java, assign multiple routes to a single view, and organize views into Java packages.


== Copy-Paste into Your Project

If you want to quickly try out a view in your Vaadin application, copy-paste the following code into a new Java class named [classname]`HelloWorldView` in your project's main package:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/buildingapps/addview/HelloWorldView.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

For more detailed instructions on how to add a view, continue reading below.


== What Is a View?

In a Vaadin application, a _view_ is a user interface component that forms a logical whole of the user interface. A page can contain other components than a view, but only one view at a time. Typically, the view takes up most of the page.

=== Views or Routes?

Each view is associated with its own URL path. When the user navigates from one view to another, the URL of the page changes. *The mapping between a URL path and a view is called a _route_*, where the *view is the _target_ of the route*.

All routes must be unique to allow the routing logic to determine the view to render without any disambiguation. When conflicts are detected, the application fails to start and logs a message explaining the reason for the conflict.

The main view of an application is mapped to the root path (`""`). It is sometimes also called the _root_ view.

== Creating Views

Vaadin views are Java classes that are annotated with [annotationname]`@Route` and extend [classname]`com.vaadin.flow.component.Component` -- or any of its subclasses. The default parameter of the [annotationname]`@Route` annotation is the path of the view.

For example, you can define the [classname]`HelloWorld` component as the main view like this:

[source,java]
----
// tag::snippet[]
@Route("")
// end::snippet[]
public class HelloWorld extends Div {
    public HelloWorld() {
        setText("Hello world");
    }
}
----

If the application is running from the root context, users would be able to access this view by navigating to `\https://example.com`.

Likewise, you can define the [classname]`CustomerListView` component as the target for the `customer/list` route:

[source,java]
----
// tag::snippet[]
@Route("customer/list")
// end::snippet[]
public class CustomerListView extends Main {
    public CustomerListView() {
        //...
    }
}
----

Users would be able to access this view by navigating to `\https://example.com/customer/list`.

[NOTE]
Don't include a leading `/` when you specify the path of a view.

Navigation between views is covered in more detail in the <<navigate#,Navigate to a View>> guide.

[TIP]
For information about package structures for Vaadin applications, see the <</building-apps/architecture/packages#,Package Structure>> architecture deep-dive.

== View Naming

If you do not specify a default parameter for [annotationname]`@Route`, the path is derived from the name of the view. The derived name is the class name in lower case, with the `View` suffix removed if there is one. Also, [classname]`MainView` and [classname]`Main` are mapped to root.

For example:

* [classname]`MyEditor` becomes `"myeditor"`
* [classname]`PersonView` becomes `"person"`
* [classname]`MainView` becomes `""`

If you specify the path explicitly, you can name your views any way you like.


== Route Aliases

You can create multiple routes that target the same view. You do this with the `@RouteAlias` annotation.

For example, you can map `\https://example.com`, `\https://example.com/home`, and `\https://example.com/main` to [classname]`HomeView` like this:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
// tag::snippet[]
@RouteAlias("home")
@RouteAlias("main")
// end::snippet[]
public class HomeView extends Div {
    public HomeView() {
        //...
    }
}
----

Whenever you use route aliases, you have to create a primary route by using the [annotationname]`@Route` annotation. Only adding [annotationname]`@RouteAlias` to a view does not work.


== Page Title

By default, Vaadin views do not set a page title. You can define the page title either declaratively or dynamically.


=== Declarative Page Title

To set a page title declaratively, use the [annotationname]`@PageTitle` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
// tag::snippet[]
@PageTitle("Home Page")
// end::snippet[]
public class HomeView extends Div {
    public HomeView() {
        //...
    }
}
----


=== Dynamic Page Title

To set the page title dynamically, implement the [interfacename]`HasDynamicTitle` interface:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
// tag::snippet[]
public class HomeView extends Div implements HasDynamicTitle {
// end::snippet[]

    public HomeView() {
        //...
    }

// tag::snippet[]
    @Override
    public String getPageTitle() {
        return "Home Page";
    }
// end::snippet[]
}
----

The title is determined when the router navigates to the view. Any changes made after navigation will not affect the title.

[IMPORTANT]
A view cannot use both the [annotationname]`@PageTitle` annotation and implement the [interfacename]`HasDynamicTitle` interface simultaneously.


== Navigation Menu Item

Most business applications include a navigation menu. This menu can be generated dynamically using Vaadin's [classname]`MenuConfiguration`. To make a view appear in the menu, add the `@Menu` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Route()
// tag::snippet[]
@Menu(title = "Dashboard", order = 1, icon = "vaadin:dashboard")
// end::snippet[]
public class DashboardView extends Main {
    public DashboardView() {
        //...
    }
}
----

The [annotationname]`@Menu` annotation has the following attributes:

`title` :: The menu title. Defaults to the page title if not specified.
`order` :: Determines the menu item's position. Items with a defined order appear above unordered items.
`icon` :: Specifies the menu icon. This is a string, allowing flexibility in interpretation. It could be an <<{articles}/components/icons#,Icon>> name or an SVG source, depending on the menu implementation.
