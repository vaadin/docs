= GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot in VS Code supports MCP servers when used in Agent mode. This enables Copilot to access Vaadin documentation for more accurate code suggestions and responses.

*Requirements:*

* VS Code 1.99 or later
* GitHub Copilot extension with Agent mode enabled

[IMPORTANT]
====
MCP servers only work when GitHub Copilot is used in *Agent mode*. Regular Copilot Chat does not support MCP.

Enterprise customers: Organizations with Copilot Business or Enterprise must enable the "MCP servers in Copilot" policy (disabled by default).
====

== Configuration

. Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root
. Add the following configuration:

[source,json]
----
{
  "servers": {
    "vaadin": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs"
    }
  }
}
----

[start=3]
. Click the Start button that appears at the top of the MCP servers list
. Switch to Agent mode: Open Copilot Chat → Click mode selector → Select "Agent"
. Click the tools icon in Agent mode to view available MCP servers

[TIP]
====
The `.vscode/mcp.json` file is project-specific. If you want to use the Vaadin MCP server across multiple projects, you'll need to add this configuration to each project.
====

== Switching to Agent Mode

Agent mode is required for MCP server support:

. Open the Copilot Chat panel in VS Code
. Look for the mode selector at the top of the chat
. Click it and select "Agent" from the dropdown
. The tools icon should now appear, showing available MCP servers

== Verify the Setup

After configuration:

. Ensure Agent mode is active
. Click the tools icon to verify the Vaadin server appears in the list
. Ask a question about Vaadin (e.g., "How do I create a Grid in Vaadin?")
. Copilot will use the Vaadin MCP server to provide documentation-based responses

== Enterprise Configuration

For organizations using Copilot Business or Enterprise:

. An administrator must enable the "MCP servers in Copilot" policy
. This setting is found in the GitHub organization's Copilot policies
. Individual developers can then configure MCP servers in their projects
. Contact your GitHub organization administrator if you don't see this option
