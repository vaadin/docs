= Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool for agentic coding. It provides native support for HTTP-based MCP servers, making it straightforward to connect to the Vaadin MCP server.

*Requirements:* Claude Code 0.4.0 or later

== Configuration

Add the following to your `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vaadin": {
      "url": "https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs"
    }
  },
}
----

After configuration, restart Claude Code to load the MCP server.

[TIP]
====
You can add multiple MCP servers to the configuration file. Each server should have a unique name in the `mcpServers` object.
====

== Alternative: CLI Configuration
Instead of manually editing configuration files, you can use Claude Code's built-in CLI commands to add the Vaadin MCP server.

=== Global Configuration
To add the Vaadin MCP server globally (available in all projects):

[source,terminal]
claude mcp add-json vaadin '{"type":"http","url":"https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs"}' --scope user

=== Project-Scoped Configuration
To add the server only for the current project, navigate to your project directory and run:

[source,terminal]
claude mcp add-json vaadin '{"type":"http","url":"https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs"}' --scope project

This creates a .mcp.json file in your project root.

[TIP]
The CLI approach is recommended for quick setup. Use claude `mcp add --help` for all available options.

== Verify the Setup

After restarting Claude Code:

. Start a new conversation
. Ask a question about Vaadin development (e.g., "How to create a Button in Vaadin?")
. Claude Code automatically uses the Vaadin MCP server to fetch relevant documentation

You can verify that the MCP server is connected by checking the status indicators in Claude Code's interface.

== Useful CLI Commands
|===
| Command | Description
| `claude mcp list`
| List all configured MCP servers
| `claude mcp remove vaadin`
| Remove the Vaadin MCP server
| `claude mcp list-tools`
| Show available tools from connected servers
