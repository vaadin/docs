= Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool for agentic coding. It provides native support for HTTP-based MCP servers, making it straightforward to connect to the Vaadin MCP server.

*Requirements:* Claude Code 0.4.0 or later

== Configuration

Add the following to your `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vaadin": {
      "url": "https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs"
    }
  }
}
----

After configuration, restart Claude Code to load the MCP server.

[TIP]
====
You can add multiple MCP servers to the configuration file. Each server should have a unique name in the `mcpServers` object.
====

== Verify the Setup

After restarting Claude Code:

. Start a new conversation
. Ask a question about Vaadin development (e.g., "How to create a Button in Vaadin?")
. Claude Code automatically uses the Vaadin MCP server to fetch relevant documentation

You can verify that the MCP server is connected by checking the status indicators in Claude Code's interface.
