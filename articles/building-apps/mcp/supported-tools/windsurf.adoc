= Windsurf

Windsurf is Codeium's AI-native IDE with built-in HTTP MCP support. Configuration is straightforward through the settings interface.

== Configuration

. Open Windsurf Settings
. Navigate to *AI* â†’ *MCP Servers*
. Add a new server with the following configuration:
** *Name:* Vaadin
** *URL:* `https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs`
. Save the configuration

Windsurf will automatically load the MCP server after saving.

[TIP]
====
You can manage multiple MCP servers in Windsurf. Each server can be enabled or disabled individually from the MCP Servers settings panel.
====

== Verify the Setup

After saving the configuration:

. Open the AI assistant panel in Windsurf
. Ask a question about Vaadin (e.g., "How do I implement routing in Vaadin?")
. The assistant will use the Vaadin MCP server to provide accurate, documentation-based responses

You can view active MCP servers in the AI settings panel.
