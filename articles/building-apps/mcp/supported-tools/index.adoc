= MCP Setup Guide

This guide provides configuration instructions for connecting your AI development tool to the Vaadin MCP server. The Vaadin MCP server gives AI assistants direct access to comprehensive Vaadin documentation, enabling accurate and context-aware responses.

Select your AI development tool for specific configuration instructions:

:supported-tools-path:
include::../index.adoc[tags=supported-tools]

== Transport Types

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Vaadin MCP server uses *HTTP transport (streamable-http)*. This is natively supported by Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot (VS Code and JetBrains IDEs), Codex, and Gemini CLI.

For stdio-only tools like Junie, you can use https://github.com/pyroprompts/mcp-stdio-to-streamable-http-adapter[@pyroprompts/mcp-stdio-to-streamable-http-adapter] as a bridge between the two transport types.

== General Setup Steps

Most tools follow these general steps:

. Locate your tool's MCP configuration file (varies by tool)
. Add the Vaadin MCP server configuration
. Restart your tool to load the MCP server
. Start asking questions about Vaadin development

See the specific instructions for your tool in the tabs above for exact configuration details.
