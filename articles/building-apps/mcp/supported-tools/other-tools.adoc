= Other Tools

The Vaadin MCP server can be used with any MCP-compatible client. Choose the appropriate configuration based on your tool's transport support.

== Tools with Native HTTP Support

If your tool supports HTTP/SSE natively, simply point it to the HTTP endpoint:

----
https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs
----

The exact configuration format depends on your specific tool. Look for settings like:

* "MCP Server URL"
* "HTTP transport"
* "Streamable HTTP"
* "Server endpoint"

Common configuration patterns:

[.tabs]
=== JSON Configuration

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vaadin": {
      "url": "https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs"
    }
  }
}
----

=== TOML Configuration

[source,toml]
----
[mcp_servers.vaadin]
url = "https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs"
----

=== YAML Configuration

[source,yaml]
----
mcpServers:
  vaadin:
    url: https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs
----

== Tools with stdio Support Only

If your tool only supports stdio transport, use an HTTP adapter to bridge stdio to HTTP:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vaadin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@pyroprompts/mcp-stdio-to-streamable-http-adapter"],
      "env": {
        "URI": "https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs",
        "MCP_NAME": "vaadin"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Adapt the JSON structure to match your tool's configuration format. The adapter uses environment variables:

* `URI` - The server endpoint
* `MCP_NAME` - An identifier for the server

[IMPORTANT]
====
The stdio adapter requires Node.js 18 or later. Install it if you haven't already:

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g @pyroprompts/mcp-stdio-to-streamable-http-adapter
----
====

== Configuration File Locations

Common locations for MCP configuration files:

* `~/.config/[tool-name]/mcp.json`
* `~/.config/[tool-name]/config.json`
* `~/.config/[tool-name]/settings.json`
* `~/.config/[tool-name]/config.toml`
* Project-specific: `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`

Consult your tool's documentation for the exact location.

== Verify the Setup

After configuration:

. Restart your tool to load the MCP server
. Start a conversation or coding session
. Ask a question about Vaadin development
. Your tool should query the Vaadin MCP server for documentation

Look for indicators in your tool's UI showing:

* Active MCP servers
* Tool invocations
* Server connection status

== Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Issue |Solution

|Server not loading
|Check configuration file syntax and location. Ensure the tool supports MCP.

|Connection errors
|Verify internet connectivity. Test the endpoint: `curl https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs`

|stdio adapter fails
|Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed. Try installing the adapter globally.

|Tool doesn't query server
|Some tools require explicit tool invocation. Try asking directly about Vaadin documentation.
