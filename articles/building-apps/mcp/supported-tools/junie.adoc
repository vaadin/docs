= Junie

Junie is JetBrains AI assistant for IntelliJ-based IDEs. It uses stdio transport and requires an adapter to connect to HTTP-based MCP servers like the Vaadin MCP server.

*Requirements:*

* Node.js 18 or later
* Junie plugin for IntelliJ-based IDEs

== Configuration

Add the following to your Junie MCP configuration file (location varies by IDE):

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vaadin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@pyroprompts/mcp-stdio-to-streamable-http-adapter"],
      "env": {
        "URI": "https://mcp.vaadin.com/docs",
        "MCP_NAME": "vaadin"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

The adapter bridges stdio transport to HTTP, allowing Junie to communicate with the Vaadin MCP server.

[NOTE]
====
Configuration file locations:

* *IntelliJ IDEA:* Check Junie plugin settings for the configuration file path
* *Other JetBrains IDEs:* Similar to IntelliJ IDEA, access through Junie settings

The exact location may vary depending on your IDE and operating system.

== How the Adapter Works

The `@pyroprompts/mcp-stdio-to-streamable-http-adapter` package:

. Receives stdio commands from Junie
. Translates them to HTTP requests
. Forwards requests to the Vaadin MCP server
. Returns responses back through stdio

This allows stdio-only tools to work with HTTP-based MCP servers.

== Verify the Setup

After configuration:

. Restart your JetBrains IDE
. Open the Junie assistant panel
. Ask a question about Vaadin development (e.g., "What are Vaadin components?")
. Junie queries the Vaadin MCP server through the adapter
