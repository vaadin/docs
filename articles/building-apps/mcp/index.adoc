= Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely integrate with external data sources and tools. Vaadin provides an MCP server that gives AI assistants direct access to comprehensive Vaadin documentation.

== What Is MCP?

Model Context Protocol allows AI development tools like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others to access structured information from external sources. This enables AI assistants to provide accurate, context-aware responses based on current Vaadin documentation.

The Vaadin MCP server provides:

* Semantic search across Vaadin documentation
* Full document retrieval for complete context
* Component version information and API references
* Component-specific API documentation (Java, React, Web Components)
* Component styling and theming information
* Support for both Java and React applications
* Current Vaadin version information
* Vaadin development primer with best practices

== Getting Started

To use the Vaadin MCP server with your AI development tool, follow these steps:

. Choose your AI development tool from the <<{articles}/building-apps/mcp/supported-tools/#,supported tools list>>
. Follow the configuration instructions for your specific tool
. Restart your tool to load the MCP server
. Start asking questions about Vaadin development

The MCP server automatically provides your AI assistant with access to up-to-date Vaadin documentation.

== Supported Tools

The Vaadin MCP server is compatible with various AI development tools. Each tool has different configuration requirements and transport support.

See the <<{articles}/building-apps/mcp/supported-tools/#,MCP Setup Guide>> for detailed configuration instructions for:

* <<supported-tools/claude-code#,Claude Code>>
* <<supported-tools/cursor#,Cursor>>
* <<supported-tools/windsurf#,Windsurf>>
* <<supported-tools/junie#,Junie (JetBrains)>>
* <<supported-tools/github-copilot#,GitHub Copilot (VS Code & JetBrains IDEs)>>
* <<supported-tools/codex#,Codex (OpenAI)>>
* <<supported-tools/gemini-cli#,Gemini CLI (Google)>>
* <<supported-tools/other-tools#,Other MCP-compatible clients>>

== Transport Types

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Vaadin MCP server uses *HTTP transport (streamable-http)*. This is natively supported by Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot (VS Code and JetBrains IDEs), Codex, and Gemini CLI.

For stdio-only tools like Junie, you can use https://github.com/pyroprompts/mcp-stdio-to-streamable-http-adapter[@pyroprompts/mcp-stdio-to-streamable-http-adapter] as a bridge between the two transport types.
