= Server Push

Server push is based on a client-server connection established by the client. The server can then use the connection to send updates to the client. For example, it could send a new chat message to all participants without delay.

The server-client communication uses a WebSocket connection, if supported by the browser and the server. If not, the connection resorts to whatever method is supported. Vaadin uses the link:https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere[Atmosphere framework], internally.

In Hilla views, push is always enabled when you subscribe to a _reactive endpoint_. For Flow views, you have to enable it, explicitly.

[IMPORTANT]
Server push is not the same as Web Push, which is also supported by Vaadin Flow. For more information, see the <<{articles}/flow/configuration/webpush#,Web Push Notifications>> documentation page.


== Enabling Push [badge-flow]#Flow#

Before you can use server push in Flow, you have to enable it. You do this by adding the `@Push` annotation to the application shell class, like this:

[source,java]
----
import com.vaadin.flow.component.page.AppShellConfigurator;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.page.Push;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
@Push
public class Application implements AppShellConfigurator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
----

// TODO Add link to page about the application shell, once is has been written (currently, the contents is scattered all over the documentation)

// TODO Transport modes? Or is that something for the reference material.
