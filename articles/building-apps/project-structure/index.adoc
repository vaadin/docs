# Project Structure

A Vaadin project is a https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] project, managed with https://maven.apache.org/[Maven].

If you are familiar with Spring Boot, chances are your favorite way of structuring your projects works fine with Vaadin as well. If Spring Boot or Maven are new to you, you should stop reading now and familiarize yourself with them before proceeding. Maven has a https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html[Getting Started Guide]. Spring Boot has an extensive https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/index.html[reference manual] that includes a https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/tutorial/first-application/index.html[tutorial].

## JAR or WAR?

Whenever you build a web application with Spring Boot, you have to decide whether to package it as a JAR-file or as a WAR-file. This also applies to Vaadin applications. Both approaches have their own pros and cons:

### Packaging as a JAR File

When a Vaadin application is packaged as a JAR-file, it contains everything it needs to run, except for the Java Virtual Machine itself. The web server, like https://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat], https://jetty.org/index.html[Jetty], or https://undertow.io/[Undertow], is embedded and you can start your application by running this command: `java -jar <your-app>.jar`

This makes the deployment simple. If you want to deploy your application to a containerized environment, you can https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/packaging/container-images/index.html:[turn your application into a container image]. If you want to deploy your application to a virtual or bare metal Linux server, you can https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/deployment/installing.html:[run it as a service] using either `init.d` or `systemd`. If you want to deploy your application to a Windows server, you can use https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw:[WinSW] to run it as a Windows service.

Another advantage is that your application runs inside its own Java Virtual Machine, and therefore its own operating system process. You can configure  and restart it without affecting other applications. If the application is compromised, or crashes, other applications running on the same physical server are better protected since they run in their own processes. This comes with a cost. Since every application runs an embedded web server, they consume more memory and more disk space, compared to a traditional Java web application. However, given that memory and disk space is quite cheap today, the cost is well worth the benefits.

Unless you have a good reason to package as a WAR file, *packaging your Vaadin application as a JAR file is the recommended choice*.

### Packaging as a WAR File

Vaadin applications can also be packaged as https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/deployment/traditional-deployment.html:[traditional Java web applications]. In this case, the resulting WAR-file must be deployed to an external web application server. You can use an open source server, such as https://tomcat.apache.org/:[Tomcat], https://jetty.org/index.html:[Jetty], or https://undertow.io/:[Undertow], or a commercial server such as JBoss or WebLogic.

A WAR-file only contains the application itself and any dependencies not provided by the web application server. Its size is therefore smaller than a self-contained JAR-file. Multiple WAR-files can be deployed to the same web application server. As the applications run inside the same JVM, the memory overhead is smaller compared to running each application inside its own JVM. The drawback of this approach is that if something happens to the JVM process, such as a memory or thread leak, all applications are affected.

You should consider WAR packaging if you already have a web application server, or if you need advanced features that are only available from a specific web application server. In all other cases, packaging as a JAR file is a better choice.

## Multi-Module or Single-Module?

You can build your Vaadin applications both as single-module Maven projects, and as multi-module Maven projects. Both options have their own pros and cons, and you should familiarize yourself with both before making a decision.
