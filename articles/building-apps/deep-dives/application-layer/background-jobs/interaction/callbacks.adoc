= Callbacks [badge-flow]#Flow# 

When using a Flow user interface, the simplest way of allowing background jobs to interact with it is through callbacks. You can use `Consumer`, `Runnable`, and `Supplier` as callback interfaces, depending on how you want to interact with the background job.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Event |Callback

|Completed without a result.
|`Runnable`

|Completed with a result of type `T`.
|`Consumer<T>`

|Completed with an exception.
|`Consumer<Exception>`

|Reported percentage done.
|`Consumer<Double>`

|Cancelled by user.
|`Supplier<Boolean>`

|===


== Returning a Result

A background job that returns a string or an exception could be implemented like this:

[source,java]
----
@Async
public void startBackgroundJob(Consumer<String> onComplete, 
                               Consumer<Exception> onError) {
    try {
        var result = doSomethingThatTakesALongTime();
        onComplete.accept(result);
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        onError.accept(result);
    }
}
----


== Reporting Progress

When the background job is also reporting its progress, for instance as a percentage number, it could look like this:

[source,java]
----
@Async
public void startBackgroundJob(Consumer<String> onComplete, 
                               Consumer<Double> onProgress, 
                               Consumer<Exception> onError) {
    try {
        onProgress.apply(0.0);

        var step1Result = performStep1();
        onProgress.apply(0.25);

        var step2Result = performStep2(step1Result);
        onProgress.apply(0.50);

        var step3Result = performStep3(step2Result);
        onProgress.apply(0.75);

        var result = performStep4(step3Result);
        onProgress.apply(1.0);

        onComplete.accept(result);
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        onError.accept(ex);
    }
}
----


== Cancelling

A job can be cancelled. To do that, it would look like this:

[source,java]
----
@Async
public void startBackgroundJob(Consumer<String> onComplete, 
                               Consumer<Double> onProgress, 
                               Consumer<Exception> onError,
                               Supplier<Boolean> isCancelled) {
    try {
        onProgress.apply(0.0);

        if (isCancelled.get()) {
            return;
        }
        var step1Result = performStep1();
        onProgress.apply(0.25);

        if (isCancelled.get()) {
            return;
        }
        var step2Result = performStep2(step1Result);
        onProgress.apply(0.50);

        if (isCancelled.get()) {
            return;
        }
        var step3Result = performStep3(step2Result);
        onProgress.apply(0.75);

        if (isCancelled.get()) {
            return;
        }
        var result = performStep4(step3Result);
        onProgress.apply(1.0);

        onComplete.accept(result);
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        onError.accept(ex);
    }
}
----

All callbacks have to be thread-safe since they're called from the background thread, but owned and created by the user interface. For more information about how to implement these callbacks, see the <<{articles}/building-apps/deep-dives/presentation-layer/server-push/callbacks#,Implementing Callbacks>> documentation page.


=== Improving Cancel API

To make the cancelling API nicer, you can replace the callback with a handle. First, create a handle interface that the user interface can use to cancel the job:

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface CancellableJob {
    void cancel();
}
----

Next, implement the service method like this:

[source,java]
----
public CancellableJob startBackgroundJob(Consumer<String> onComplete, 
                                         Consumer<Double> onProgress
                                         Consumer<Exception> onError) {
    var cancelled = new AtomicBoolean(false);
    taskExecutor.execute(() -> {
        try {
            onProgress.apply(0.0);

            if (cancelled.get()) {
                return;
            }
            var step1Result = performStep1();
            onProgress.apply(0.25);

            if (cancelled.get()) {
                return;
            }
            var step2Result = performStep2(step1Result);
            onProgress.apply(0.50);

            if (cancelled.get()) {
                return;
            }
            var step3Result = performStep3(step2Result);
            onProgress.apply(0.75);

            if (cancelled.get()) {
                return;
            }
            var result = performStep4(step3Result);
            onProgress.apply(1.0);

            onComplete.accept(result);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            onError.accept(result);
        }
    });
    return () -> cancelled.set(true);
}
----

The user interface would have to store the handle while the job is running, and call the `cancel()` method to cancel it. However, you can't use the `@Async` annotation in this case. It's because `@Async` methods can only return `void` or future-like types. In this case, you may want to return neither.

The handle itself is thread safe because you're using an `AtomicBoolean`. You don't need to take any special precautions to call it from the user interface.
