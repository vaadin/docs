= Implementing Callbacks [badge-flow]#Flow#

When building the user interface with Vaadin Flow, the easiest way of allowing a background job to update the user interface is through callbacks. This is explained in more detail in the <<{articles}/building-apps/application-layer/background-jobs/interaction/callbacks#,Callbacks>> documentation page.

Whenever you implement a callback, you have remember that the callback is called by the background thread. This means that any updates to the user interface must happen inside a call to `UI.access()`.

[NOTE]
The examples on this page only work with push enabled. For information about how to do that, see the <<.#enabling-push-flow,Server Push>> documentation page.

For every callback, you should create a private method in your user interface. The method is called inside `UI.access()`, so you can safely update the user interface inside it.

For example, a method for handling successful completion could look like this:

[source,java]
----
private void onJobCompleted(String result) {
    Notification.show("Job completed: " + result);
}
----

Likewise, a method for handling errors might be done like this:

[source,java]
----
private void onJobFailed(Exception error) {
    Notification.show("Job failed: " + error.getMessage());
}
----

For reporting progress, you can use a <<{articles}/components/progress-bar#,progress bar>>. If the background jobs reports the progress as a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0, you can pass it directly to the `setValue` method of the progress bar.

Here is an example of a button click listener that starts a background job, and uses the private methods, and the progress bar, to update the user interface:

[source,java]
----
button.addClickListener(clickEvent -> {
    var ui = UI.getCurrent();
    service.startBackgroundJob(
        ui.accessLater(this::onJobCompleted, null), // <1>
        ui.accessLater(progressBar::setValue, null),
        ui.accessLater(this::onJobFailed, null)
    );
});
----
<1> The `UI.accessLater()` method is explained on the <<updates#access-later,Pushing UI Updates>> documentation page.
