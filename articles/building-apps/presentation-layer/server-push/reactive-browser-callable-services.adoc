// TODO This text assumes that browser callable endpoints have already been explained earlier.

When building a user interface with Vaadin Hilla, you would use reactive browser callable services to push messages from the server to the browser. A reactive service is a service that returns a `Flux` from https://projectreactor.io/[Reactor]. 

Here is an example of a browser callable service that emits the current date and time every second:

[source,java]
----
@BrowserCallable
public class TimeService {

    @AnonymousAllowed
    public Flux<@Nonnull String> getClock() {
        return Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1)) // <1>
                .onBackpressureDrop() // <2>
                .map(_interval -> Instant.now().toString()); // <3>
    }
}
----
<1> Emit a new message every second.
<2> Drop any messages that for some reason can't be sent to the client in time.
<3> Output the current date and time as a string.

Hilla generates the necessary TypeScript types to subscribe to this service from the browser.
