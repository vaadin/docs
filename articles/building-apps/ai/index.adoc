= AI in Vaadin Applications

In this part of the documentation, we want to show you how you connect a Vaadin application to a Large Language Model (LLM) and efficiently leverage the benefits of it for your workflows. We will use common use cases of typical Vaadin applications as examples and apply common UI patterns for AI integration to create intuitive interfaces and make the in your application more efficient. The focus is on simple examples that you can adapt for your application and can be implemented quickly. We show you how to connect your application to an AI client and which components you can use for a user-friendly, intuitive, and AI-supported workflow.

We use common Java librariesâ€”such as Spring AI and LangChain4j to call hosted or local models and integrate them into both services and Vaadin views. Examples rely on `MessageInput` and `MessageList` to collect prompts and render responses (e.g. Markdown), keep long conversations focused with a `Scroller`, and deliver real-time updates via `Vaadin Push`.
