= AI in Vaadin Applications

In this section, you'll learn how to connect a Vaadin application to a Large Language Model (LLM) and integrate AI features into your workflows. Using common Vaadin application scenarios as examples, you'll explore typical UI patterns for AI integration. The focus is on simple, adaptable examples that you can quickly implement in your own projects.

You'll learn how to:

* connect your application to an AI client with popular Java libraries such as Spring AI and LangChain4j,
* choose Vaadin components that create intuitive, AI-powered workflows -- such as `MessageInput`, `MessageList`, and `Scroller`, and
* deliver real-time updates to users through server push.
