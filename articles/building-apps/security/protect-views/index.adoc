Logging in and out ensures that only *authenticated users* can access the application. However, most business applications require more than just authenticationâ€”different types of users often have varying levels of access.

In role-based applications, users are assigned specific _roles_ that determine what data they can access and which actions they can perform. To enforce these restrictions, you must implement proper *authorization* for your views.
