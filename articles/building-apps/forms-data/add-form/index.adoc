= Add a Form

In business applications, forms play a central role in displaying and collecting data. Since users often spend a significant amount of time interacting with forms, they must meet high standards for usability and functionality. A well-designed form should follow the logic of the business process it supports, validate input effectively, give clear and helpful feedback, support keyboard-only navigation, and be accessible to all users. As a result, implementing forms can become complex.

Vaadin offers a range of components and utilities to simplify form building. However, because forms and data binding cover a broad area, the topic is divided into several focused guides. Each one covers a specific aspect of form development. This particular guide explains how to build forms visually in both Flow and Hilla.
