= Dialogs & Drawers

In business applications, dialogs are commonly used for creating new items, while drawers are typically used for editing existing ones. Drawers are often tied to a selection. When a user selects an item, the drawer is shown; when the drawer is closed, the selection is typically cleared. 

By implementing the form as a class of its own, you can reuse it in both dialogs and drawers. The following guides show you how to do that in both Flow and Hilla:

* <<flow#,Form Dialogs and Drawers in Flow>>
* (Hilla version is coming soon)
