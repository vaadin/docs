= Dialogs & Drawers

In business applications, dialogs are typically used for creating new items, while drawers are more often used for editing existing ones. Drawers are often tied to a selection. Selecting an item typically opens a drawer, closing the drawer then clears the selection.

By implementing the form as a standalone component, you can reuse it in both dialogs and drawers. The following guides show you how to do that in both Flow and Hilla:
