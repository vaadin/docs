= Dialogs & Drawers

In business applications, dialogs are typically used for creating new items, while drawers are more often used for editing existing ones. Drawers are often tied to a selection. Selecting an item typically opens a drawer, closing the drawer then clears the selection.

[TIP]
This is part 4 of the *Add a Form* series. It builds on the concepts introduced in the <<../fields-and-binding#,Fields & Binding>>, <<../validation#,Form Validation>> and <<../loading-and-saving#,Loading & Saving>> guides.

By implementing the form as a standalone component, you can reuse it in both dialogs and drawers. The following guides show you how to do that in both Flow and Hilla:

* <<flow#,Form Dialogs and Drawers in Flow>>
* <<hilla#,Form Dialogs and Drawers in Hilla>>
