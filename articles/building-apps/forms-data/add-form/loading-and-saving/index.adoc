= Load and Save a Form
:toclevels: 2

In a typical Vaadin application, a dedicated application service loads and saves Form Data Objects (FDOs). While the design principles apply to both Flow and Hilla, Hilla introduces architectural constraints due to its client-server communication model. These constraints -- and application services in general -- are explained in detail in the <<../../../business-logic/add-service#,Add a Service>> guide.

// TODO When written, add links to the Persistence guides where appropriate.

== Loading Strategies

In a Vaadin application, there are two common approaches to loading forms, each suited to different use cases.

* *Load from Selection* -- A UI component, such as a grid, displays a list of FDOs. When the user selects an item, the form is populated directly with the selected object.
* *Fetch and Load* -- The application receives the ID of the FDO to edit, either through a method call or a <<../../../views/pass-data#,URL parameter>>. It then fetches the object from an application service before populating the form.


== Saving Strategies

As there are two loading strategies, there are also two saving strategies, each suited to different use cases.

* *Single Save* -- The application uses the same operation to both insert and update data. The application service decides which operation to execute based on the presence or absence of an ID in the FDO. This is the simplest approach.
* *Insert/Update* -- The application uses separate operations for inserting and updating data. The user interface decides which method to call. This approach is useful when you want to separate persistence concerns from the domain model, or when working with immutable value objects like Java records.


== Application Service Design

The application service's API depends on several aspects:

* the loading and saving strategy
* whether you're using entities or dedicated classes (or records) as FDOs
* what your UI does after it has saved an FDO

This section covers the basics of designing an application service for loading and saving an FDO. The implementation of the service is not covered in this guide.


=== Load from Selection

You don't need a separate `findById` method when using *Load from Selection*. All the information you need is returned by the list function. Here is an example of a list function that can be used to <<{articles}/components/grid#lazy-loading,lazy-load a Grid>>:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW) // <1>
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()") // <2>
public class ProposalService {

    public List<Proposal> list(Pageable pageable) {}
        // Return a page of proposals
    }
}
----
<1> Always use transactions when saving and loading data.
<2> Always secure your application services. See the <<{articles}/building-apps/security/protect-services#,Protect Services>> guide for details.

// TODO Link to the article about grids once it's written.


=== Fetch and Load

If you're using *Fetch and Load*, you need a separate method for fetching the FDO based on its ID, like this:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class ProposalService {

    public Optional<Proposal> findById(long proposalId) {
        // Find and return the proposal.
    }
}
----


=== Single Save

In *Single Save*, the application service must be able to decide whether the FDO is new or persistent. This is typically done by including the entity ID in the FDO. If unsaved, this ID is `null`:

.Proposal.java
[source,java]
----
public class Proposal {
    private Long proposalId;
    // (Other fields omitted for brevity)

    public @Nullable Long getProposalId() {
        return proposalId;
    }
    public void setProposalId(@Nullable Long proposalId) {
        this.proposalId = proposalId;
    }
}
----

Here's an example of an application service that saves and retrieves a `Proposal` FDO:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW) // <1>
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()") // <2>
public class ProposalService {

    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
    public Proposal save(Proposal proposal) {
        // Validate and save the proposal.
    }

    // (Other methods omitted for brevity)
}
----
<1> Always use transactions when saving and loading data.
<2> Always secure your application services. See the <<{articles}/building-apps/security/protect-services#,Protect Services>> guide for details.

Returning the saved FDO allows the UI to access generated fields, such as IDs or timestamps, without needing to reload the data. However, if your UI does not need the result -- for example if it navigates to a different view, or refreshes itself -- the method should not return anything.

[NOTE]
This approach works well when you use the entity itself as an FDO.


=== Insert/Update

When you're using *Insert/Update*, you typically store the ID outside of the FDO. A convenient way of doing this is to introduce a wrapper class that includes the ID:

[source,java]
----
public final class PersistentProposal { // <1>
    private final long proposalId;
    private final Proposal proposal;

    public PersistentProposal(long proposalId, Proposal proposal) {
        this.proposalId = proposalId;
        this.proposal = proposal;
    }

    public Proposal unwrap() {
        return proposal;
    }
}
----
<1> You could also use a Java record for this.

The wrapper class can include other metadata, such as a version number for optimistic locking.

The following example demonstrates how the `Proposal` and `PersistentProposal` classes are used in an application service:

.ProposalService.java
[source,java]
----
@Service
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class ProposalService {

    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
    public PersistentProposal insert(Proposal proposal) {
        // Validate and insert the proposal.
    }

    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
    public PersistentProposal update(PersistentProposal proposal) {
        // Validate and update the proposal.
    }

    // (Other methods omitted for brevity)
}
----

Each method returns a new instance of `PersistentProposal`, making it easy to pass updated metadata to the UI. Again, if the UI does not need this information, the methods can return `void`.


== Form Integration

You've now seen two common ways to design application services. Next, learn how these services integrate with Flow and Hilla forms.
