= Add a Form in Flow
:toclevels: 2

In this guide, you'll learn the basics of creating a form in Flow and binding it to a form data object. You'll learn the difference between using a JavaBean and a Java record as form data object, and their pros and cons. Because data binding in Flow is a large topic, this guide only contains enough to get you started. For more details, see Flow's <<{articles}/flow/binding-data#,Forms & Data Binding>> reference guide.


== Laying Out the Fields

In Flow, you build the form visually by *adding input components to a layout component*. The most common layout components for forms are <<{articles}/components/form-layout#,FormLayout>> and <<{articles}/components/vertical-layout#,VerticalLayout>>. `FormLayout` supports multiple columns, whereas `VerticalLayout` lays out the components in a single column. You also often end up combining these with <<{articles}/components/horizontal-layout#,HorizontalLayout>>, which lays out its components in a single row.

[IMPORTANT]
Layout components are not the same as router layouts. However, you can build a router layout using layout components.

The follow example shows how to build a two-column project proposal form with various input components:

.ProposalForm.java
[source,java]
----
public class ProposalForm extends Composite<FormLayout> { // <1>

    public ProposalForm() {
        var titleField = new TextField("Title");
        getContent().add(titleField); // <2>

        var proposalTypeField = new ComboBox<ProposalType>("Proposal Type");
        proposalTypeField.setItems(ProposalType.values());
        getContent().add(proposalTypeField);

        var descriptionField = new TextArea("Description");
        getContent().add(descriptionField);
        getContent().setColspan(descriptionField, 2); // <3>

        var startDateField = new DatePicker("Start Date");
        getContent().add(startDateField);

        var endDateField = new DatePicker("End Date");
        getContent().add(endDateField);
    }
}
----
<1> `Composite` hides the API of `FormLayout` from users of `ProposalForm`, reducing the risk of misuse.
<2> `getContent()` returns the `FormLayout`.
<3> Since `FormLayout` has two columns by default, this makes the description field take up the full width of the layout.

The finished form would look like this:

`FormLayout` is responsive, which means that if there is not enough room, the layout adjusts to a single column, with each input component on its own row. It also has other features not presented here. For
more information see the <<{articles}/components/form-layout#,FormLayout>> documentation.
