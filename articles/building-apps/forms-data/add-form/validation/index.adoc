= Form Validation

Form validation is a fundamental aspect of building robust and user-friendly applications. It ensures that the data entered by users meets the expected format and business rules before it's processed or stored. Effective validation helps safeguard the *security* and *integrity* of your application. It also enhances the *user experience* by providing immediate feedback and preventing common input errors.

To learn more about validation from a broader architectural perspective, see the <<{articles}/building-apps/deep-dives/application-layer/consistency#,Data Consistency>> deep dive.
