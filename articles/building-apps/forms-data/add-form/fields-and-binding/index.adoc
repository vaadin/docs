= Fields and Binding

Forms are used to display and edit data in UI components called *fields*. This data comes from a *Form Data Object* (FDO), which is structured to align with the fields in the form. Each form field typically maps to a corresponding property in the FDO.

FDOs are often fetched from and submitted to an <<../loading-and-saving#,application service>> for processing, such as validation and persistence. Architecturally, *an FDO belongs to the application layer*, not the presentation layer.


.Entities as Form Data Objects
[IMPORTANT]
In simple cases -- such as CRUD views and administration screens -- the form model and the domain model may be the same. In those cases, *you can use your entities as FDOs*. However, doing so *couples your domain logic to the UI*. This can lead to maintainability issues, especially if UI requirements evolve independently of business logic. When that happens, it's better to introduce a dedicated FDO and handle data conversion in the application service.

Data is exchanged between the form and the FDO through *data binding*. Typically, each field is bound to a specific property of the FDO. The binding mechanism keeps the form and the FDO in sync.

Both Flow and Hilla have many different field components and offer built-in support for data binding:
