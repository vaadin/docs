# Vaadin and Spring Boot

The recommended way of building Vaadin applications is with https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot]. This means that a Vaadin application is, in its essence, a Spring Boot application with a Vaadin user interface. Everything you can do in a Spring Boot application, you can also do in a Vaadin application. 

If you are already familiar with Spring Boot, feel free to skip this page and go straight to <<architecture#,Architecture>> or <<project-structure#,Project Structure>>.

## What Is Spring Framework?

Spring Framework is a Java framework that was originally created around 2003 as a response to the then overly complicated J2EE platform. Spring offered a simpler, more straight forward, way of building enterprise applications in Java. One of the most important concepts that Spring introduced was *Inversion of Control* (IoC).

In a traditional computer program, the program controls its own flow by creating objects and calling methods. IoC is a principle in which the control flow is handed over to an external source, such as a framework. The framework would then be responsible for creating and destroying the objects, and calling methods, according to some specification.

Spring introduced the concept of a bean container, where beans where Java objects instantiated and managed by Spring. If bean A depended on bean B, Spring would make sure that bean B was initialized before bean A. Spring would also inject the instance of bean B into bean A, removing the need for bean A to look up its own dependencies. This pattern is called *dependency injection*.

The developer would write the classes and create a *bean configuration* which instructed Spring how to wire up the beans. This configuration was originally written in XML, but nowadays it is created using a combination of Java annotations, Java code and conventions.

Spring Framework also introduced a lot of other features and has grown to a platform of its own since its first release. However, the concepts of dependency injection and bean configurations are key to understanding the Vaadin Way of architecting applications.

## What Is Spring Boot?

As the Spring platform grew, it also became more complicated to build Spring applications. In addition, the software industry was starting to adopt microservices and deploying them in containerized environments. It had to become easier to build lightweight web applications that could run as standalone services, as opposed to being deployed to a dedicated application server.

Spring Boot was created in response to these needs. It took an opinionated look at how to best create Spring applications, provided sensible defaults, starter dependencies, and production-ready features for application configuration and observability. It also introduced embedded servlet containers, making it possible to package the application as a self-contained, executable JAR-file.

In practice, this reduced the boilerplate code and configuration complexity of traditional Spring applications to a minimum. Developers could now create full-blown, production-ready Java web applications with only a few lines of code.

## How Does Vaadin Fit Into the Picture?

Vaadin has been around as long as Spring has. Although it has always been possible to use Spring and Vaadin together, it wasn't until the introduction of Spring Boot that official Spring support was added to Vaadin. Over the years, the Spring support has been expanded to such a degree that it is now the recommended way of building Vaadin applications.

A Vaadin application consists of <<architecture/layers#,two conceptual layers>>: the presentation layer and the application layer. The presentation layer is the user interface, and the application layer everything else, like the domain model, services, persistence, and so on.

You build the presentation layer using Vaadin, which allows you to use either Java, React or both, depending on your needs and skills.

You build the application layer using Spring Boot and everything it has to offer, which is not little.

The combined versatility of Vaadin and Spring Boot means you have a wide and deep toolbox at your disposal. This can become confusing or overwhelming at times. Spring Boot provided an opinionated view of the Spring platform to make it easier to use. The Vaadin Way provides an opinionated view of building business applications with Vaadin and Spring Boot to make it easier for you.
