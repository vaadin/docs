== Before You Start

* Delete the `node_modules` folder and either lock file: `package-lock.json` (with npm) or `pnpm-lock.yaml` (with pnpm)

* Edit the `pom.xml` file and change the Vaadin version to [.vaadin-to-version-full]`new version`.

== Update to Java 11

- Java version requirement changes from Java 8 to Java 11
+
For Maven update the java.version
+
[source, xml]
----
<properties>
    <java.version>11</java.version>
</properties>
----
+
or compiler.source and compiler.target
+
[source, xml]
----
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
----

- For Java 9+ `maven-failsafe-plugin` requires jaxb-impl to be added
+
The dependency can be added directly in the plugin definition as:
+
[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
            <artifactId>jaxb-impl</artifactId>
            <version>${jaxb.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
----

== Update Spring Version

Vaadin is compatible with Spring 5.3.0 or newer, and Spring Boot 2.4.0 or newer.
If your application uses an older version of Spring, update it to a compatible version:

[source,xml]
----
include::../../../pom.xml[tag=spring-version, indent=0]
----

== Update Main Layout/View Annotations

Several annotations typically placed on the `MainLayout` / `MainView` class must be moved to a class that implements the `AppShellConfigurator` interface, for example:

[source,java]
----
@PWA(name = "My Vaadin App", shortName = "my-app")
public class AppShell implements AppShellConfigurator {

}
----

see <<{articles}/flow/advanced/modifying-the-bootstrap-page#java-annotations, set of annotations to modify the Bootstrap page>> for more details.

== Replace Obsolete APIs

A set of API breaking changes and their replacements are listed below:

- Property synchronization methods in `Element` are replaced with similar API in `DomListenerRegistration`: `getSynchronizedPropertyEvents`, `getSynchronizedProperties`, `removeSynchronizedPropertyEvent`, `removeSynchronizedProperty`, `addSynchronizedPropertyEvent`, `addSynchronizedProperty`,  `synchronizeProperty`.
- JavaScript execution APIs `executeJavaScript` and `callFunction` in `Element` and `Page` are replaced with similarly named methods that give access to the return value `executeJs` and `callJsFunction`:
- Miscellaneous `Element` methods: `Element(String, boolean)`, `addEventListener(String, DomEventListener, String...)`
- Device and platform detection methods `WebBrowser#isIOS()`, `WebBrowser#isIPad()`, `BrowserDetails#isSafariOrIOS()`, `BrowserDetails#isIOS()`, `BrowserDetails#isIPad()` are replaced with method in `ExtendedClientDetails`: `isIPad()`, `isIOS()`
- Methods `JsModule#loadMode()` and `Page#addJsModule(String, LoadMode)` for setting the load mode of JsModule are removed since it does not function with JavaScript modules.
- The construction methods `BeforeEvent(NavigationEvent, Class<?>)` and `BeforeEvent(Router, NavigationTrigger, Location, Class<?>, UI)` in `BeforeEvent` are replaced with `BeforeEvent(NavigationEvent, Class, List)` and `BeforeEvent(Router, NavigationTrigger, Location, Class, UI, List)`
-  Methods `getUrl()`, `getUrlBase()` and `getRoutes()` in `Router` are replaced with methods `getUrl()`, `getUrlBase()` and `getAvailableRoutes()` in `RouterConfiguration`. The `resolve()` method in `Router` is replaced with the `resolve()` method in `RouteUtil`. The `getRoutesByParent()` method in `Router` is removed and has no replacement.
- `ServletHelper` is replaced with `HandlerHelper`
- `ExecutionCanceler` is replaced with `PendingJavaScriptResult`
- The `getBodyAttributes` method in `AbstractTheme`, `Lumo` and `Material` is replaced with `getHtmlAttributes`
- The `removeDataGenerator` method in `HasDataGenerators` and `CompositeDataGenerator` is removed in favor of using the registration returned from `addDataGenerator(DataGenerator)`
- The methods `preventsDefault` and `stopsPropagation` in `ShortcutRegistration` are replaced with `isBrowserDefaultAllowed ` and `isEventPropagationAllowed`
-  The `safeEscapeForHtml` method in `VaadinServlet` is removed in favor of using `org.jsoup.nodes.Entities#escape(String)`
- The static method `getInstance` in `ApplicationRouteRegistry` is removed in favor of the instance method.
- The protected instance method `getApplicationUrl` from `VaadinServlet` is removed


== Bootstrapping Changes

For applications upgraded from earlier versions of Vaadin, client-side bootstrapping requires replacing the usages of the V10-14 `BootstrapHandler` APIs with their `IndexHtmlRequestHandler` API counterparts as described in <<{articles}/flow/advanced/modifying-the-bootstrap-page#IndexHtmlRequestListener-interface, _IndexHtmlRequestListener interface_>> section.

The reason for this API change is that with client-side bootstrapping the initial page HTML generation is separated from loading the Flow client and creating a server-side `UI` instance.

- In Vaadin 10 to 14 these two steps are combined and the `index.html` page includes the code and configuration needed to start the Flow client engine and link the browser page to the server-side `UI` instance.

- In Vaadin 15+ with client-side bootstrapping the `index.html` page includes only the basic HTML markup and links to the TypeScript UI code. If you have https://hilla.dev/docs/routing[client-side/Hilla views], the `UI` is not guaranteed to be created, thus is optional. It will be only available after the user navigates to a server-side route.

It is also possible to continue using the bootstrapping mode in V10-14 with the `useDeprecatedV14Bootstrapping` flag.
See how the use the flag in <<{articles}/flow/configuration/properties#, Configuration Properties>>.


== Frontend Package Manager Changes from pnpm to npm
+
The default package manager is now npm, but if using a version older than
8.3 it is recommended to use pnpm instead.
+
To keep using pnpm the configuration pnpm.enable should be set.
+
.Maven
[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>flow-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <pnpmEnable>true</pnpmEnable>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----
+
.Gradle
[source, groovy]
----
vaadin {
  pnpmEnable = true
}
----
+
Or using the system property `vaadin.pnpm.enable=true`
+
[NOTE]
Running `npm` without a [filename]#package-lock.json# will be slow for the initial installation.
A project that comes from `pnpm` will not have an `npm` [filename]#package-lock.json#, as it uses [filename]#pnpm-lock.yaml#.

- Recommended minimum version of npm is v8.3
+
This is to have the support for overrides to lock transitive dependencies versions.

- When the global node is not compatible, the version in `~/.vaadin` will be used.
+
If a version does not exist or is too old it will be automatically downloaded and installed.

== Vaadin Charts

*Vaadin Charts* now defaults to Java styling mode in Flow, instead of CSS styling mode.
If you have applied custom styles to charts using CSS, you need to make the following change to switch your charts back to CSS styling mode

[source,java]
----
Chart chart = new Chart();
Configuration conf = chart.getConfiguration();
conf.getChart().setStyledMode(true);
----

== Assorted Changes

- `AppShellRegistry` method `getTitle()` is removed 
It was broken and could not work. Instead, if needed, use `getUI().getUIInternals().getAppShellTitle()`. 

- Having the `@Theme` annotation on Flow views or router layouts will no longer be allowed.
The annotation should be on [interfacename]#AppShellConfigurator# instead. 
This is now consistent with the `@PWA` annotation.
It is also cleaner, since you can only have one `@Theme` per application. 


- `AbstractListDataView` now requires an extra constructor argument - a callback, which is invoked each time when the component's filter and/or sorting changes through the data view API.

- Setting the tabindex attribute to a value > 0 (for example, by calling [methodname]#setTabIndex(10)#) is no longer supported on input field components.
pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->]
However, tabindex values of 0 and -1 are still supported.

== Input Fields: Removed Support for tabindex > 0

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]
The following general changes have been made to all input field components:

* https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/issues/3275[Removed support for using positive `tabindex` values] (for example, `setTabIndex(1)`) on all input field components. 
This will not cause errors but has no effect.
However, setting `tabindex` to `0` or `-1` is still supported.
It is recommended to ensure that input fields are in the correct order in the DOM, instead of overriding the tab order with `tabindex`.
