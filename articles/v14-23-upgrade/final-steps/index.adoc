= Final Vaadin 14 to 23 Upgrade Steps

== Bootstrapping Changes

For applications upgraded from earlier versions of Vaadin, client-side bootstrapping requires replacing the usages of the V10-14 `BootstrapHandler` APIs with their `IndexHtmlRequestHandler` API counterparts as described in <<{articles}/flow/advanced/modifying-the-bootstrap-page#IndexHtmlRequestListener-interface, _IndexHtmlRequestListener interface_>> section.

The reason for this API change is that with client-side bootstrapping the initial page HTML generation is separated from loading the Flow client and creating a server-side `UI` instance.

- In Vaadin 10 to 14 these two steps are combined and the `index.html` page includes the code and configuration needed to start the Flow client engine and link the browser page to the server-side `UI` instance.

- In Vaadin 15+ with client-side bootstrapping the `index.html` page includes only the basic HTML markup and links to the TypeScript UI code. If you have https://hilla.dev/docs/routing[client-side/Hilla views], the `UI` is not guaranteed to be created, thus is optional. It will be only available after the user navigates to a server-side route.

It is also possible to continue using the bootstrapping mode in V10-14 with the `useDeprecatedV14Bootstrapping` flag.
See how the use the flag in <<{articles}/flow/configuration/properties#, Configuration Properties>>.


== Replace Deprecated APIs

- JavaScript execution APIs `executeJavaScript` and `callFunction` in `Element` and `Page` should be replaced with similarly named methods that give access to the return value `executeJs` and `callJsFunction`.
- `ExecutionCanceler` is replaced with `PendingJavaScriptResult`
- The `PageConfigurator` interface is deprecated; customize initial page settings instead by overriding `AppShellConfigurator::configurePage`.
