= Final Vaadin 14 to 23 Upgrade Steps

== Bootstrapping Changes

For applications upgraded from earlier versions of Vaadin, client-side bootstrapping requires replacing the usages of the V10-14 [classname]`BootstrapHandler` APIs with their [classname]`IndexHtmlRequestHandler` API counterparts as described in <<{articles}/flow/advanced/modifying-the-bootstrap-page#IndexHtmlRequestListener-interface, _IndexHtmlRequestListener interface_>> section.

The reason for this API change is that with client-side bootstrapping the initial page HTML generation is separated from loading the Flow client and creating a server-side [classname]`UI` instance.

- In Vaadin 10 to 14 these two steps are combined and the [filename]#index.html# page includes the code and configuration needed to start the Flow client engine and link the browser page to the server-side [classname]`UI` instance.

- In Vaadin 15 and later with client-side bootstrapping the [filename]#index.html# page includes only the basic HTML markup and links to the TypeScript UI code. If you have https://hilla.dev/docs/routing[client-side/Hilla views], the [classname]`UI` is not guaranteed to be created, thus is optional. It will be only available after the user navigates to a server-side route.

It is also possible to continue using the bootstrapping mode in V10-14 with the `useDeprecatedV14Bootstrapping` flag.
See how the use the flag in <<{articles}/flow/configuration/properties#, Configuration Properties>>.


== Replace Deprecated APIs

- JavaScript execution APIs [methodname]`executeJavaScript()` and [methodname]`callFunction()` in [classname]`Element` and [classname]`Page` should be replaced with similarly named methods that give access to the return value [methodname]`executeJs()` and [methodname]`callJsFunction()`.
- [classname]`ExecutionCanceler` is replaced with [classname]`PendingJavaScriptResult`
- The [interfacename]`PageConfigurator` interface is deprecated; customize initial page settings instead by overriding [methodname]`AppShellConfigurator::configurePage()`.
- [classname]`TemplateRenderer` for Grid and Combo Box (which is based on Polymer templates) is now deprecated in favor of [classname]`LitRenderer`.
For example, the following usage of the [classname]`TemplateRenderer`
[source, java]
----
TemplateRenderer.of("<order-card"
	+ "  header='[[item.header]]'"
	+ "  order-card='[[item.orderCard]]'"
	+ "  on-card-click='cardClick'>"
	+ "</order-card>");
----
Would be replaced using [classname]`LitRenderer` as follows
[source, java]
----
LitRenderer.of("<order-card"
	+ "  .header='${item.header}'"
	+ "  .orderCard='${item.orderCard}'"
	+ "  @card-click='${cardClick}'>"
	+ "</order-card>");

Also check the following external https://43081j.com/2018/08/future-of-polymer[blog post] for the differences between Polymer and Lit syntax.

== Update Source Control Settings

Vaadin 23 involves some minor changes in the layout and content of Vaadin projects.
Be sure to visit the <<{articles}/flow/configuration/source-control#, Source Control section>> to check the directory layout of a Vaadin 23 application, and update your version control settings accordingly.

== Use Security Helpers

Vaadin 23 comes with a view-based access control mechanism that make it easier, faster, and safer for Vaadin developers to utilize security in their web applications.
To enable this access-control mechanism, see the <<{articles}/flow/integrations/spring/view-based-access-control#, instructions for a Spring project>> or the <<{articles}/flow/security/best-practices#view-based-access-control, instructions for a plain-Java project>>.
