= Defining Routes

You can use the `@Route` annotation to define any component as a route target for a given URL fragment.

*Example*: Defining the [classname]`HelloWorld` component as the default route target (empty route) for your application.

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class HelloWorld extends Div {
    public HelloWorld() {
        setText("Hello world");
    }
}
----

*Example*: Defining the [classname]`SomePathComponent` component as the target for the specific route `"some/path"`.

[source,java]
----
@Route("some/path")
public class SomePathComponent extends Div {
    public SomePathComponent() {
        setText("Hello @Route!");
    }
}
----

Assuming your application is running from the root context, when the user navigates to `\http://example.com/some/path`, either by clicking a link in the application or entering the address in the address bar, the [classname]`SomePathComponent` component is shown on the page.

If you omit the `@Route` annotation parameter, the route target is derived from the class name.
For example:

- [classname]`MyEditor` becomes `"myeditor"`
- [classname]`PersonView` becomes `"person"`
- [classname]`MainView` becomes `""`
