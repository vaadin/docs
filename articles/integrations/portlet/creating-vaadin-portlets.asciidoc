= Creating Vaadin Portlets

This section describes how to create Vaadin Portlets and how to deploy them to the https://liferay.com/products/dxp[Liferay 7 Digital Experience Platform].


== Creating a Vaadin Portlet

You can create a Vaadin Portlet either from scratch, or from the https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-flow-portlet[base-starter-flow-portlet] project. The starter project contains everything needed to create your own Vaadin Portlet, quickly. It includes the basic code you'll need.

To become familiar with setting up a Vaadin Portlet project, start with a simple Vaadin project and then convert it into a Vaadin Portlet project.


=== Portlet Project Set Up

First, download the https://github.com/vaadin/skeleton-starter-flow/tree/v23/[Vaadin base starter]. Then, update your [filename]`pom.xml` file by adding the following dependencies:

.pom.xml Additions
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-portlet</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.portlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>portlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Vaadin Portlet doesn't work in development mode running `vaadin-dev-server`. Therefore, add a `build-frontend` goal to `vaadin-maven-plugin`.


=== Create the Portlet

In the most basic setup, Vaadin Portlets consist of two classes. First, there's a *portlet class*, which extends [classname]`VaadinLiferayPortlet` or [classname]`VaadinPortlet` -- when running in non-Liferay Portal. It acts as the entry point for your Vaadin Portlet application. It serves a similar function to a Servlet, but in a portlet context.

Second, there's a portlet *view class*, which extends [classname]`Component`. The view class, which can be any normal Vaadin component, contains the contents of your Vaadin Portlet. You could use an existing component through extension, composition, or as it is. Or you can create an entirely new component for your Vaadin Portlet. [classname]`VaadinPortlet` and [classname]`VaadinLiferayPortlet` are generic classes. They take the selected view class as a type parameter.


==== Class Preparations

Find the [filename]`MainView.java` provided with the project and create a file named [filename]`MyPortlet.java` in the same folder. Inside that file, add the following code:

.MyLiferayPortlet.java for Liferay Portals
[source,java]
----
@PortletConfiguration(
    portletName = "MyLiferayPortlet",
    dependencies = @Dependency(name = "PortletHub", scope = "javax.portlet", version = "3.0.0")
)
public class MyLiferayPortlet extends VaadinLiferayPortlet<MainView> {

}
----

.MyPortlet.java for Non-Liferay Portals
[source,java]
----
public class MyPortlet extends VaadinPortlet<MainView> {

}
----

Next, open the [filename]`MainView.java` file. Remove both the [annotationname]`@Route` and [annotationname]`@PWA` annotations since they won't make sense for your portlet.

The final code should look something like this:

.MainView.java
[source,java]
----
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    public MainView() {
        Button button = new Button("Click me",
                event -> Notification.show("Clicked!"));
        add(button);
    }
}
----

When a user clicks on the `Click me` button, a notification with the text `Clicked!` should appear in the lower-left corner of the browser window. Your Vaadin Portlet is almost ready to go. You only need to prepare it for deployment.


=== Deployment Descriptor

In the Portlet 3.0 specification, the portlet deployment descriptor can be configured in two ways: with [filename]`portlet.xml`, which is backwards-compatible; and with annotations, which is available only with Portlet 3.0.

You'll use the [filename]`portlet.xml` file to configure your portlet deployment. It serves the same purpose as the [filename]`web.xml` file for servlets.

Create the [filename]`portlet.xml` file in the `{project directory}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` directory and add the following content:

.portlet.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<portlet-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/portlet"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/portlet http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_3_0.xsd"
             version="3.0">
    <portlet>
        <portlet-name>MyLiferayPortlet</portlet-name>
        <display-name>MyLiferayPortlet</display-name>
        <portlet-class>org.vaadin.example.MyPortlet</portlet-class>
        <expiration-cache>0</expiration-cache>
        <supports>
            <mime-type>text/html</mime-type>
            <portlet-mode>view</portlet-mode>
        </supports>
        <portlet-info>
            <title>My Test Portlet - MyPortlet</title>
            <short-title>My Test Portlet</short-title>
            <keywords></keywords>
        </portlet-info>
    </portlet>
</portlet-app>
----

The `<portlet-class>` points to your class extending [classname]`VaadinPortlet`/[classname]`VaadinLiferayPortlet` with a fully qualified name. The `<supports>` section contains the portlet modes (i.e., `<portlet-mode>` tag) that the portlet supports. You can learn more about portlet modes for Vaadin Portlet in <<handling-portlet-phases.asciidoc#,the next article>>.


=== Descriptors Specific to Liferay

To run Vaadin Portlets in Liferay Portal, you'll need to set portlet descriptors that are specific to Liferay: `liferay-display.xml` and `liferay-portlet.xml`.

The descriptor, `liferay-display.xml` describes the category under which the portlet appears in the `Add` menu of Liferay's Widgets bar. The descriptor, `liferay-portlet.xml` describes Liferay-specific enhancements for Java Specification Requests (JSR) 286 portlets installed on a Liferay Portal server.

Create the [filename]`liferay-display.xml` and [filename]`liferay-portlet.xml` files in the `{project directory}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` directory. Add the following respective content to those files:

.[filename]`liferay-display.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE display PUBLIC "-//Liferay//DTD Display 6.2.0//EN" "http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-display_6_2_0.dtd">

<display>
    <category name="Vaadin Liferay Portlets">
        <portlet id="MyLiferayPortlet" />
    </category>
</display>
----

.[filename]`liferay-portlet.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE liferay-portlet-app PUBLIC "-//Liferay//DTD Portlet Application 7.1.0//EN" "http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-portlet-app_7_1_0.dtd">

<liferay-portlet-app>
    <portlet>
        <portlet-name>MyLiferayPortlet</portlet-name>
        <!-- Instanceable parameter means whether we can add the Portlet more than once on same page.-->
        <instanceable>false</instanceable>
    </portlet>
</liferay-portlet-app>
----

[NOTE]
The `instanceable` parameter specifies whether the Portlet can be added more than once on the same page. If it's set to `false`, it can be added only once on a page.


=== External Stats URL

Next, you need to set an external stats URL in Liferay. If your portlet runs in *Liferay Portal*, add the following resource file, [filename]`flow-build-info.json` into `{project directory}/src/main/resources/META-INF/VAADIN/config` with this content:

.[filename]`flow-build-info.json`
[source,json]
----
{
    "externalStatsUrl": "/o/vaadin-portlet-static/VAADIN/config/stats.json"
}
----


[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V23.2"]
=== webpack for Front-End Builds

Starting with Vaadin 23.2, Vite is the default tool for front-end builds. However, Vaadin Portlet requires webpack to be used. To use webpack, you must enable it with the `webpackForFrontendBuild` feature flag.

.[filename]`src/main/resources/vaadin-featureflags.properties`
[source,properties]
----
com.vaadin.experimental.webpackForFrontendBuild=true
----

See <<{articles}/configuration/feature-flags#,Feature Flags>> for more information.



== Deploying Your Vaadin Portlet

Assuming all went correctly, you're now ready to deploy your Vaadin Portlet. First, you'll have to build it. Then you'll have to configure static resources. Last, you'll deploy your Vaadin Portlet to Liferay 7. These steps are described in the following sub-sections.


=== Building the Vaadin Portlet

To build the portlet you created, you must add some more configuration to the [filename]`pom.xml` file. Vaadin Portlet deployments are packaged into two `WAR` files. One `WAR` file contains all of the static resources shared by the Vaadin Portlets, and the other contains the actual portlets. This allows for more complex scenarios where multiple portlets come from separate `WAR` files (see <<creating-multi-module-portlet-project.asciidoc#,Creating Multi-Module Portlet Project>>).

Add the following plugin configuration to the [filename]`pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.3</version>

                <Implementation-Version>${project.version}</Implementation-Version>
            </manifestEntries>
        </archive>
    </configuration>
    <!-- Generate 2 war archives for portlet. One for the portlet(s) and another for the static files -->
    <executions>
        <!-- Generate a static war 'vaadin-portlet-static.war' with all static files -->

            <goals>

        </execution>
        <!-- Generate the portlet war excluding any static build files -->
        <execution>
            <id>portlet-war</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>war</goal>

                        <!--
                        Include original flow-build-info.json, not the one produced by vaadin plugin
                        and included in the static portlet
                        -->
                        <includes>
                            <include>META-INF/VAADIN/config/flow-build-info.json</include>

                    </resource>
                </webResources>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

In this example, you're building two `WAR` files: one for the application (i.e., all portlets in the project); and the other for the static files needed by the portlets, which contains the front-end bundle and client engine.

The static `WAR` is built as a portal window that can load only a single Vaadin bundle and client engine at a time. This provides a simple way for all of the portlets on the page to use the same static bundle.


==== Configuring Static Resources

If you need to change the name of the static assets `WAR` -- by default it's `vaadin-portlet-static` -- you can do so via the `vaadin.portlet.static.resources.mapping` application property. For example, if you want to serve static resources from `vaadin-static-resources.war`, you need do the following:

- Rename the static `WAR` to `vaadin-static-resources` in the [filename]`pom.xml` file;
- Change the static portlet name in the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file -- if Liferay is used; and
- Pass the value `/vaadin-static-resources/` -- for *Liferay Portal*, it would be `/o/vaadin-portlet-resources/` -- via the application property to the Vaadin application.

For this last step, on the Tomcat web server you would do things a little differently, depending on the operating system. On Unix-based operating systems, create or edit the file [filename]`$CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh` with this line:

[source,bash]
----
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dvaadin.portlet.static.resources.mapping=/vaadin-static-resources/"
----

On Windows operating systems, create or edit the file [filename]`%CATALINA_BASE%\bin\setenv.bat` with this line:

[source,bash]
----
set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dvaadin.portlet.static.resources.mapping=/vaadin-static-resources/"
----


=== Deploying to Liferay 7

The last major step for your Vaadin Portlet is to deploy it to Liferay 7. To do this, there are a few system and software requirements. Then you'll have to add some property files and do some configuring.


==== System & Software Requirements

First, execute `mvn install` in your project directory. Then download https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/releases[Liferay Bundle] and extract it to a location you prefer.

Add the following parameter to Liferay Tomcat's [filename]`setenv.sh` file, located in `{liferay home}/tomcat-<version>/bin`:

[source,bash]
----
-Dvaadin.portlet.static.resources.mapping=/o/vaadin-portlet-static/
----

Now download and copy the Java Native Access (JNA) `JAR` dependencies for the specific version into `{liferay home}/tomcat-<version>/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib` or `shielded-container-lib`, depending on the version: https://search.maven.org/artifact/net.java.dev.jna/jna/5.7.0/jar[`net.java.dev.jna:jna:5.7.0`]; or https://search.maven.org/artifact/net.java.dev.jna/jna-platform/5.7.0/jar[`net.java.dev.jna:jna-platform:5.7.0`].

This is needed because Vaadin Portlet uses a newer version of the JNA library, which can cause conflicts with the version that Liferay uses.


==== Property Files & Configurations

Create a [filename]`portal-ext.properties` file in Liferay's home directory and put this property in it:

[source,bash]
----
javascript.single.page.application.enabled=false
----

Copy both `WAR` files from `{project directory}/target` into `{liferay home}/deploy`.

Next, start the web server by opening a command prompt in the `{bundle extract directory}` folder and then executing `./{tomcat-version}/bin/startup.sh` on Unix systems, or `./{tomcat-version}/bin/startup.bat` on Windows.

Once the web server has started, navigate to http://localhost:8080/ and follow the instructions of the Liferay wizard to set up a new user and sign in to the Portal. In the Portal are only a few more steps:

- Click the "Menu" button at the top-left corner to open the menu console.
- Find and click the "Page tree" link and then the "+" button to add a new page.
- Select "Widget Page", give it a name, and then select the appropriate layout.
- In the "Look and Feel" tab, select "Define a specific look and feel for this page", and enable "Show Maximize/Minimize" and then "Save".

Finally, navigate to the home page, then to the layout you created. Click the "Add" button, which is usually placed at the top-right corner, and find the category "Vaadin Liferay Portlets". Open it and drag the portlet item from the panel to the page. You should see the portlet with the title [guilabel]*MY TEST PORTLET - MYPORTLET* and a [guibutton]*Click me* button in the content area.
