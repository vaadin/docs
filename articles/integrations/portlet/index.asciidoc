Portlet is a technology for building web components to be placed on Web Portals. Vaadin provides the API to create a UI to be visible in Portlets in the same way as for a Vaadin Servlet-based application.

Vaadin Portlet Support for Vaadin 23 is built on top of the https://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/portlet-3-final-spec/[Portlet 3.0 Specification]. The Vaadin Portlet add-on was developed and tested with Liferay 7, but can be run in other portals supporting Portlet 3.0 and JDK 11+.

== Limitations and Known Issues

- Vaadin Portlet doesn't support integration with `OSGi`, which comes with Liferay 7. Vote for https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/10939/[OSGi support for Vaadin Portlet] if you need it in your project and leave a comment about your use cases.
- The `Vaadin Push` feature is https://github.com/vaadin/portlet/issues/200/[not supported] at the moment. Vaadin client-to-server polling can be used as a replacement.
- The `SPA` feature isn't supported and needs to be disabled for Liferay; see the https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030752391-Disabling-SPA/[SPA issue].
- The Vaadin Portlet API for changing Portlet's mode and state doesn't work with Liferay; see https://github.com/vaadin/portlet/issues/214[this issue].
- The [annotationname]`@PWA` annotation and all PWA features aren't supported.
