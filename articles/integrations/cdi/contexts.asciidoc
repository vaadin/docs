= Vaadin CDI Scopes & Contexts

In addition to standard CDI contexts, the https://vaadin.com/directory/component/vaadin-cdi/[Vaadin CDI] add-on introduces new contexts.

Vaadin CDI contexts are conceptually similar to <<../spring/scopes#,Vaadin Spring scopes>>.


== Normal Scopes

In CDI, most scopes are normal scopes. This means that most calls to managed beans are delegated by a client proxy to the active instance. The active instance is provided by the context.

The https://vaadin.com/directory/component/vaadin-cdi/[Vaadin CDI] add-on introduces the `@VaadinServiceScoped`, `@VaadinSessionScoped`, `@NormalUIScoped`, and `@NormalRouteScoped` normal scopes.

[NOTE]
The Vaadin component hierarchy doesn't work with CDI client proxies. As a precaution, the `vaadin-cdi` add-on doesn't deploy if managed beans are found.


== Pseudo-Scopes

Any scope that isn't a normal scope is called a pseudo-scope. The standard `@Dependent` and `@Singleton` are pseudo-scopes.

The Vaadin add-on additionally introduces the `@UIScoped` and `@RouteScoped` pseudo-scopes.

Injection of a pseudo-scoped bean creates a direct reference to the object, but there are some limitations when not using proxies:

- Circular referencing, for example injecting A to B and B to A, doesn't work.
- Injecting into a larger scope binds the instance from the currently active smaller scope, and ignores changes in the smaller scope. For example, after being injected into a session scope, a `@UIScoped` bean points to the same instance (even if its [classname]`UI` is closed), regardless of the current [classname]`UI`.

Pseudo-scopes aren't bean-defining annotations, so, in implicit bean archives, [annotationname]`@UIScoped` and [annotationname]`@RouteScoped` components need to be marked with the [annotationname]`@CdiComponent` stereotype annotation, which lets the container scan and manage the instances of the annotated types.

See https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/1.2/cdi-spec.html#normal_scope for more information about scopes and pseudo-scopes.


=== Using Push

Vaadin contexts are usable inside the [methodname]`UI.access()` method with any push transport.

Certain default contexts from CDI, such as `RequestScoped` or `SessionScoped`, can be problematic. `HttpServletRequest` can't be resolved from a WebSocket connection in CDI, although this is needed for HTTP request, session, and conversation contexts. You should, therefore, use `WEBSOCKET_XHR` (the default), or `LONG_POLLING` transport mode, to avoid losing the standard contexts.

Background-thread contexts that depend on HTTP requests aren't active, regardless of push.

See <<../../advanced/server-push#push.access,Asynchronous Updates>> for more about using push.


=== @VaadinServiceScoped Context

The `@VaadinServiceScoped` context manages the beans during the Vaadin service lifecycle. The lifecycle of the service is the same as the lifecycle of its Vaadin servlet. See <<../../advanced/application-lifecycle#vaadin-servlet-and-service,Vaadin Servlet and Service>> for more about the Vaadin service.

For beans that are automatically picked up by `VaadinService`, you need to use the `@VaadinServiceEnabled` annotation, together with the `@VaadinServiceScoped` annotation. See <<service-beans#,Vaadin Service Interfaces as CDI Beans>> for more.


=== @VaadinSessionScoped Context

The `@VaadinSessionScoped` context manages the beans during the Vaadin session lifecycle. This means that the same bean instance is used within the whole Vaadin session.

See <<../../advanced/application-lifecycle#user-session,User Session>> for more.

The example below shows how to use the `@VaadinSessionScoped` annotation on route targets:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class MainLayout extends Div {
    @Inject
    public MainLayout(SessionService bean){
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@Route("editor")
public class Editor extends Div {
    @Inject
    public Editor(SessionService bean){
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@VaadinSessionScoped
public class SessionService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText(){
        return "session " + uid;
    }
}
----

Because it's session-scoped, the same instance of [classname]`SessionService` is used if the application is accessed from the same Vaadin session.

If you open the root target in one tab and the `editor` target in another, the text in both is the same. This is because the session is the same, even though the tabs (and [classname]`UI` instances) are different.


== @UIScoped and @NormalUIScoped Contexts

The `@UIScoped` and `@NormalUIScoped` contexts manage the beans during the [classname]`UI` lifecycle. Use `@UIScoped` for components and `@NormalUIScoped` for other beans.

See <<../../advanced/application-lifecycle#loading-a-ui,Loading a UI>> for more about the [classname]`UI` lifecycle.

The example below uses the `@NormalUIScoped` annotation on route targets:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class MainLayout extends Div {
    @Inject
    public MainLayout(UIService bean){
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@Route("editor")
public class Editor extends Div {
    @Inject
    public Editor(UIService bean){
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@NormalUIScoped
public class UIService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText(){
        return "ui " + uid;
    }
}
----

Because it's UI scoped, the same [classname]`UIService` is used while in the same [classname]`UI`.

If you open the root target in one tab and the `editor` target in another, the text is different, because the [classname]`UI` instances are different.

If you navigate to the `editor` instance via the router (or the [classname]`UI` instance, which delegates navigation to the router) the text is the same.

In the example here, it navigates to the `editor` target:

[source,java]
----
public void edit() {
    getUI().get().navigate("editor");
}
----

In the same [classname]`UI` instance, the same bean instance is used with both `@UIScoped` and `@NormalUIScoped`.


== @RouteScoped & @NormalRouteScoped Contexts

`@RouteScoped` and `@NormalRouteScoped` manage the beans during the [classname]`Route` lifecycle. Use `@RouteScoped` for components and `@NormalRouteScoped` for other beans.

Together with the `@RouteScopeOwner` annotation, both `@RouteScoped` and `@NormalRouteScoped` can be used to bind beans to router components (`@Route`, `RouteLayout`, `HasErrorParameter`). While the owner remains in the route chain, all the beans it owns remain in the scope.

See <<../../routing#,Defining Routes With @Route>> and <<../../routing/layout#,Router Layouts and Nested Router Targets>> for more about route targets, route layouts, and the route chain.

Below uses the `@NormalRouteScoped` annotation on route targets:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
@RoutePrefix("parent")
public class ParentView extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
    @Inject
    public ParentView(
            @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            RouteService routeService) {
        setText(routeService.getText());
    }
}

@Route(value = "child-a", layout = ParentView.class)
public class ChildAView extends Div {
    @Inject
    public ChildAView(
            @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            RouteService routeService) {
        setText(routeService.getText());
    }
}

@Route(value = "child-b", layout = ParentView.class)
public class ChildBView extends Div {
    @Inject
    public ChildBView(
            @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            RouteService routeService) {
        setText(routeService.getText());
    }
}

@NormalRouteScoped
@RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
public class RouteService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText() {
        return "ui " + uid;
    }
}
----

[classname]`ParentView`, [classname]`ChildAView`, and [classname]`ChildBView` (paths: `/parent`, `/parent/child-a`, and `/parent/child-b`) use the same [classname]`RouteService` instance while you navigate between them. After navigating away from [classname]`ParentView`, the [classname]`RouteService` is also destroyed.

Even though `@RouteScopeOwner` is redundant because it's a CDI qualifier, you need to define it on both the bean and on the injection point.

Route components can also be `@RouteScoped`. In this case, `@RouteScopeOwner` should point to a parent layout. If you omit it, the route itself becomes the owner.

Here's how you might use the `@RouteScoped` annotation on an `@Route` component:

[source,java]
----
@Route("scoped")
@RouteScoped
@CdiComponent
public class ScopedView extends Div {
    private void onMessage(
            @Observes(notifyObserver = IF_EXISTS)
            MessageEvent message) {
        setText(message.getText());
    }
}
----

The message is delivered to the `ScopedView` instance where the user already navigated. If on another view, there is no instance of this bean and the message isn't delivered to it.


=== Preserving Beans during Browser Refresh

By default, when the user refreshes the page, all routing components are recreated. This applies to `@UIScoped` and `@RouteScoped` beans, too. New bean instances are created and injected to the new routing components. It's possible to tell the framework to preserve the routing components during refresh with the `@PreserveOnRefresh` annotation. See the <<../../advanced/preserving-state-on-refresh.asciidoc#,Preserving the State on Refresh>> documentation page for more information.

When the `@PreserveOnRefresh` annotation is used on a routing component that has `@RouteScoped` beans injected into it, the beans are preserved too.

The example that follows shows beans being preserved with `@RouteScopeOwner` targeting a component with `@PreserveOnRefresh`:

[source,java]
----
@RouteScoped
@RouteScopeOwner(MainLayout.class)
public class PreservedBean {
    private String uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    public String getText() {
        return uuid;
    }
}
@Route("") // optional, could use a subview with @Route instead
@PreserveOnRefresh
public class MainLayout extends VerticalLayout implements RouterLayout {
    @Inject
    @RouteScopeOwner(MainLayout.class)
    private PreservedBean bean;
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        add(new Span("UUID:" + bean.getText()));
    }
}
----

In this example, both the [classname]`MainLayout` component and the [classname]`PreservedBean` injected bean are preserved after browser refresh. The text stays the same.

If the `@PreserveOnRefresh` annotation is removed from the layout, both the component and the bean are recreated after browser refresh. The text would change.


==== UIScoped Beans Aren't Preserved

Injected beans aren't preserved when they're `UIScoped`, but only when they're `RouteScoped`, regardless of whether `@PreserveOnRefresh` is used. However, any currently active routing components are preserved, even if they're `UIScoped`. This is due to the nature of the `@PreserveOnRefresh` feature implementation.

The `UI` instance itself isn't preserved, but routing components are. Any bean tied to the `UI` instance with `UIScoped` is recreated, and the preserved routing components are moved to the new `UI`. To preserve beans during a browser refresh, you need to use `@RouteScoped`, as shown earlier.
