= Vaadin CDI Scopes and Contexts

In addition to standard CDI contexts, the https://vaadin.com/directory/component/vaadin-cdi/[Vaadin CDI] add-on introduces new contexts.

Vaadin CDI contexts are conceptually similar to <<../spring/scopes#,Vaadin Spring scopes>>.


== Normal Scopes

In CDI, most scopes are normal scopes. This means that most calls to managed beans are delegated by a client proxy to the active instance. The active instance is provided by the context.

The https://vaadin.com/directory/component/vaadin-cdi/[Vaadin CDI] add-on introduces the `@VaadinServiceScoped`, `@VaadinSessionScoped`, `@NormalUIScoped`, and `@NormalRouteScoped` normal scopes.

[NOTE]
The Vaadin component hierarchy doesn't work with CDI client proxies. As a precaution, the `vaadin-cdi` add-on doesn't deploy if managed beans are found.


== Pseudo-Scopes

Any scope that isn't a normal scope is called a pseudo-scope. The standard `@Dependent` and `@Singleton` are pseudo-scopes.

The Vaadin add-on additionally introduces the `@UIScoped` and `@RouteScoped` pseudo-scopes.

Injection of a pseudo-scoped bean creates a direct reference to the object, but there are some limitations when not using proxies:

** Circular referencing, for example injecting A to B and B to A, doesn't work.
** Injecting into a larger scope binds the instance from the currently active smaller scope, and ignores changes in the smaller scope.
For example, after being injected into a session scope, a `@UIScoped` bean points to the same instance (even if its [classname]`UI` is closed), regardless of the current [classname]`UI`.

Pseudo-scopes aren't bean-defining annotations, so, in implicit bean archives, [annotationname]`@UIScoped` and [annotationname]`@RouteScoped` components need to be marked with the [annotationname]`@CdiComponent` stereotype annotation, which lets the container scan and manage the instances of the annotated types.
See https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/1.2/cdi-spec.html#normal_scope for more information about scopes and pseudo-scopes.


=== Using Push

Vaadin contexts are usable inside the [methodname]`UI.access()` method with any push transport.

Certain default contexts from CDI, such as `RequestScoped` or `SessionScoped`, can be problematic.
HttpServletRequest can't be resolved from a WebSocket connection in CDI, although this is needed for HTTP request, session, and conversation contexts.
You should, therefore, use `WEBSOCKET_XHR` (the default), or `LONG_POLLING` transport mode, to avoid losing the standard contexts.

Background-thread contexts that depend on HTTP requests aren't active, regardless of push.

See <<../../advanced/server-push#push.access,Asynchronous Updates>> for more about using push.


=== @VaadinServiceScoped Context

The `@VaadinServiceScoped` context manages the beans during the Vaadin service lifecycle.
The lifecycle of the service is the same as the lifecycle of its Vaadin servlet.
See <<../../advanced/application-lifecycle#vaadin-servlet-and-service,Vaadin Servlet and Service>> for more about the Vaadin service.

For beans that are automatically picked up by `VaadinService`, you need to use the `@VaadinServiceEnabled` annotation, together with the `@VaadinServiceScoped` annotation.
See <<service-beans#,Vaadin Service Interfaces as CDI Beans>> for more.


=== @VaadinSessionScoped Context

The `@VaadinSessionScoped` context manages the beans during the Vaadin session lifecycle. This means that the same bean instance is used within the whole Vaadin session.

See <<../../advanced/application-lifecycle#user-session,User Session>> for more.

*Example*: Using the `@VaadinSessionScoped` annotation on route targets.

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class MainLayout extends Div {
    @Inject
    public MainLayout(SessionService bean){
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@Route("editor")
public class Editor extends Div {
    @Inject
    public Editor(SessionService bean){
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@VaadinSessionScoped
public class SessionService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText(){
        return "session " + uid;
    }
}
----

* Because it's session-scoped, the same instance of [classname]`SessionService` is used if the application is accessed from the same Vaadin session.
* If you open the root target in one tab and the `editor` target in another, the text in both is the same.
This is because the session is the same, even though the tabs (and [classname]`UI` instances) are different.

== @UIScoped and @NormalUIScoped Contexts

The `@UIScoped` and `@NormalUIScoped` contexts manage the beans during the [classname]`UI` lifecycle.
Use `@UIScoped` for components and `@NormalUIScoped` for other beans.

See <<../../advanced/application-lifecycle#loading-a-ui,Loading a UI>> for more about the [classname]`UI` lifecycle.

*Example*: Using the `@NormalUIScoped` annotation on route targets.

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class MainLayout extends Div {
    @Inject
    public MainLayout(UIService bean){
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@Route("editor")
public class Editor extends Div {
    @Inject
    public Editor(UIService bean){
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@NormalUIScoped
public class UIService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText(){
        return "ui " + uid;
    }
}
----
* Because it's UI scoped, the same [classname]`UIService` is used while in the same [classname]`UI`.
* If you open the root target in one tab and the `editor` target in another, the text is different, because the [classname]`UI` instances are different.
* If you navigate to the `editor` instance via the router (or the [classname]`UI` instance, which delegates navigation to the router) the text is the same.
+
*Example*: Navigating to the `editor` target.
+
[source,java]
----
public void edit() {
    getUI().get().navigate("editor");
}
----

* In the same [classname]`UI` instance, the same bean instance is used with both `@UIScoped` and `@NormalUIScoped`.

== @RouteScoped and @NormalRouteScoped Contexts

`@RouteScoped` and `@NormalRouteScoped` manage the beans during the [classname]`Route` lifecycle.
Use `@RouteScoped` for components and `@NormalRouteScoped` for other beans.

Together with the `@RouteScopeOwner` annotation, both `@RouteScoped` and `@NormalRouteScoped` can be used to bind beans to router components (`@Route`, `RouteLayout`, `HasErrorParameter`).
While the owner remains in the route chain, all the beans it owns remain in the scope.

See <<../../routing#,Defining Routes With @Route>> and <<../../routing/layout#,Router Layouts and Nested Router Targets>> for more about route targets, route layouts, and the route chain.

*Example*: Using the `@NormalRouteScoped` annotation on route targets.
[source,java]
----
@Route("")
@RoutePrefix("parent")
public class ParentView extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
    @Inject
    public ParentView(
            @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            RouteService routeService) {
        setText(routeService.getText());
    }
}

@Route(value = "child-a", layout = ParentView.class)
public class ChildAView extends Div {
    @Inject
    public ChildAView(
            @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            RouteService routeService) {
        setText(routeService.getText());
    }
}

@Route(value = "child-b", layout = ParentView.class)
public class ChildBView extends Div {
    @Inject
    public ChildBView(
            @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            RouteService routeService) {
        setText(routeService.getText());
    }
}

@NormalRouteScoped
@RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
public class RouteService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText() {
        return "ui " + uid;
    }
}
----

* [classname]`ParentView`, [classname]`ChildAView`, and [classname]`ChildBView` (paths: `/parent`, `/parent/child-a`, and `/parent/child-b`) use the same [classname]`RouteService` instance while you navigate between them.
After navigating away from [classname]`ParentView`, the [classname]`RouteService` is also destroyed.
* Even though `@RouteScopeOwner` is redundant because it's a CDI qualifier, you need to define it on both the bean and on the injection point.

Route components can also be `@RouteScoped`.
In this case, `@RouteScopeOwner` should point to a parent layout.
If you omit it, the route itself becomes the owner.

*Example*: Using the `@RouteScoped` annotation on an `@Route` component.

[source,java]
----
@Route("scoped")
@RouteScoped
@CdiComponent
public class ScopedView extends Div {
    private void onMessage(
            @Observes(notifyObserver = IF_EXISTS)
            MessageEvent message) {
        setText(message.getText());
    }
}
----
* The message is delivered to the `ScopedView` instance that was already navigated to.
If on another view, there is no instance of this bean and the message isn't delivered to it.
