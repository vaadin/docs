= Loading Theme Images from Java Code

Images and other assets in the theme folder – except for stylesheets – can be loaded from server side code, since the `frontend/themes` folder is automatically copied to the resource folder as part of the build process. The path to the theme folder is `“themes/theme-name/”`, where `theme-name` is the name of the theme folder.

[source]
----
[project root]
└── frontend
    └── themes
        └── my-theme
            └── image.png
----

.java
[source,java]
----
Image img = new Image("themes/my-theme/image.png", "An image in the theme");
----

Note that this does not work for stylesheets. Stylesheets need to be placed in the resource folder to be <<loading-styles-dynamically#, loaded dynamically>> from the server side. <<{articles}/application/resources#, Read more about loading images on the server side.>>
