Material is a theme inspired by the original Material Design guidelines.

The core Material package defines the basic building blocks for component themes as CSS custom properties, also known as design tokens, such as colors, typography and other visual styles.

Apply the Material theme with the `@Theme` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Theme(themeClass = Material.class)
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer
                         implements AppShellConfigurator {
  ...
}
----

You can enable the dark mode variant by providing the variant parameter.

[source,java]
----
@Theme(themeClass = Material.class, variant = Material.DARK)
----

[NOTE]
In many respects, the <<{articles}/styling/lumo#, Lumo theme>> offers a more feature-rich set of CSS properties than the Material theme.
