= Material Theme

Material is a theme inspired by the Material Design guidelines.

The core Material package defines the basic building blocks for component themes as CSS custom properties, also known as design tokens, such as colors, typography and other visual styles.

[Note]
In many respects, the <<{articles}/styling/lumo#, Lumo theme>> offers a more feature-rich set of CSS properties than the Material theme.
