= Loading Stylesheets Dynamically

Stylesheets can be loaded dynamically based on application logic on the server side. This can be useful, for example, to load styles based on the current user, or to allow the user to switch between different themes, manually.

This is done using the `addStyleSheet` method on the [classname]`Page` class, which takes a URL parameter. The URL can point either to a stylesheet served by the application itself, located in the resource folder `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources` (or in `src/main/webapp` for non-Spring apps packaged as WARs), or to an external URL.

[source,java]
----
/* Local style sheet served by the application */
/* Located in src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/dynamic-styles.css */
UI.getCurrent().getPage().addStyleSheet("dynamic-styles.css");
/* Style sheet loaded from an external URL */
UI.getCurrent().getPage().addStyleSheet("https://example.com/styles.css");
----

Files loaded this way are applied to the entire UI in the current session, and remain applied until the end of the session.

Dynamic stylesheets can be removed using the [classname]`Registration` instance returned by the `addStyleSheet` method.

[source,java]
----
/* Add dynamic stylesheet */
Registration registration = UI.getCurrent().getPage().addStyleSheet("dynamic-styles.css");
/* Remove dynamic stylesheet when it is not needed anymore */
registration.remove();
