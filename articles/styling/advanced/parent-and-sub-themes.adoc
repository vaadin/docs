= Parent Themes pass:[&] Sub-Themes

Multiple themes can be combined in the same application by configuring one of them as a _parent theme_ to the other. This is typically used for sharing a common base theme (<<multi-app-themes#, packaged as a JAR dependency>>) across multiple applications, and loading application-specific themes on top of the base theme.

A theme is configured as a parent theme through the parent property in the theme configuration file `theme.json` in the applicationâ€™s theme folder:

.my-application-theme/theme.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "parent": "my-base-theme"
}
----

[source,java]
----
@Theme("my-application-theme")
public class Application implements AppShellConfigurator {
  ...
}
----

In the example above, `my-base-theme` is loaded as the parent theme, and `my-application-theme` is loaded on top of it.

It's also possible to <<loading-styles-dynamically#, load additional stylesheets dynamically>> on top of the application theme.
