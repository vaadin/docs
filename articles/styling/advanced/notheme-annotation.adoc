= Disabling Lumo Using the @NoTheme Annotation

If needed, you can disable the Lumo theme for your application using the `@NoTheme` annotation.

However, rather than disabling Lumo, it's usually more convenient to build on Lumo by overriding its CSS properties.
This approach is described in the <<{articles}/styling/getting-started#styling.get-started.overriding-lumo,getting started with styling>> guide, and the full list of Lumo CSS properties can be found in the <<{articles}/styling/lumo/design-tokens#, Design Tokens>> section.

The `@NoTheme` annotation must be added on a class that implements the [interfacename]`AppShellConfigurator` interface.

For example, the annotation can be used in a class that looks something like the following:

.`MyAppShell.java`
[source, java]
----
@NoTheme
public class MyAppShell implements AppShellConfigurator {
}
