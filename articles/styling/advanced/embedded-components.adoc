= Styling Embedded Components

Custom Flow UI components, or even entire Flow views or applications, can be <<{articles}/flow/integrations/embedding#,embedded>> into other web pages by exporting them as server-side generated Web Components.

Because these embedded components are rendered inside shadow DOM wrappers, their styles need to be loaded in a different way than those of Vaadin applications: by applying the [classname]`@CssImport` annotation to the component’s root class (the class that extends [classname]`WebComponentExporter`) to load a stylesheet from the `src/main/frontend` folder.

----
[project root]
└── src
    └── main
        └── frontend
            └── my-embeddable-component.css
----

[source,java]
----
@CssImport("my-embeddable-component.css")
public class MyEmbeddableComponent extends WebComponentExporter<Div> {
 ...
}
----

[source,css]
----
/* src/main/frontend/my-embeddable-component.css */

/* Loading Aura theme into the exported component */
@import "@vaadin/aura/aura.css";

/* Custom CSS for the embedded component */
:host {
  ...
}
----
The Lumo or Aura theme can be applied to the component by using an `@import` rule that references the theme’s npm package path:

* *Aura*: `@vaadin/aura/aura.css`
* *Lumo*: `@vaadin/vaadin-lumo-styles/lumo.css`

If the embedded component is also used as a normal Flow component in a Flow application, it is recommended to load all styles for the application with [classname]`@CssImport` (from the `src/main/frontend folder`) instead of the usual way with [classname]`@StyleSheet`, in order to avoid conflicts and duplication between styles loaded by the component and the application.
