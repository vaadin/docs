= Disabling the Default Theme

Although not a recommended approach to styling Vaadin applications, the default Lumo theme can be disabled using the `@NoTheme` annotation. This is applied to the same class to which you would normally apply the <<../application-theme#applying-a-theme, `@Theme` annotation>>.

[source,java]
----
@NoTheme
public class Application implements AppShellConfigurator {
    …
}
----

With the Lumo theme disabled, Vaadin components will load with only the most basic CSS required for them to be functional.
