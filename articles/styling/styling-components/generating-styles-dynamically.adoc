= Generating Styles Dynamically

CSS is inherently static, but sometimes you need to generate styles dynamically based on some custom logic. One way to do this is to use the `Style` API in Flow to set inline CSS properties on the root element directly, supplying either static or dynamically generated values:

[source,java]
----
Button btn = new Button("Click me");
btn.getStyle().set("color", "white");
btn.getStyle().set("background-color", getRandomColor());
----

A drawback with this approach is that it's not possible to apply styles to parts of components, or based on their states.

Another option is to use style properties – either the built-in <<../lumo/lumo-style-properties#, Lumo properties>> or <<../advanced/custom-style-properties#, custom ones>> – that are statically applied with normal CSS, but whose values are set through application logic:

[source,css]
----
vaadin-button {
  color: var(--my-button-text-color);
  background-color: var(--my-button-bg-color);
}
----

[source,java]
----
UI.getCurrent().getElement().getStyle().set("--my-button-text-color", "white");
UI.getCurrent().getElement().getStyle().set("--my-button-bg-color", getRandomColor());
----

The benefit of this approach is that you can target component parts and multiple components with the same style property. This can be used for example to load domain-specific styles in a white-labeled SaaS application, or to allow the user to customize UI styles, store them into a database, and load them when the user logs in.

.Style API Cannot Return Styles Applied through Stylesheets
[NOTE]
The Style API in Flow, used through the `getStyle()` method, only works with _inline_ styles – styles applied to the HTML element directly, as opposed to via stylesheets. This means that style getters, such as `getStyle().get(“color”),` only return values that have been applied using the Style API.  It cannot return styles applied through stylesheets.
