= Styling Vaadin Components

There are two primary ways to style Vaadin components: to customize Lumo style properties and to apply custom CSS.

Using Lumo style properties, identified by the `--lumo-` prefix, is the best way to modify styles across all Vaadin components. For example, in addition to applying a consistent visual brand for an entire application (or <<../advanced/multi-app-themes#, multiple applications>>), they can also be scoped to views, layouts, and components. Style property values are assigned in CSS stylesheets, but require minimal knowledge of CSS.

Applying custom CSS to components requires more CSS knowhow, but can be necessary to introduce styling that is not covered by style properties.

In both cases, styles are applied with CSS stylesheets, typically placed in the <<../application-theme#, application theme folder>>, for example in the `styles.css` master stylesheet.

A stylesheet contains one or more style blocks, consisting of a _selector_ that specifies the HTML elements to which the styles are applied, and, within curly braces, a set of style properties and their values:

[source,css]
----
vaadin-text-field {
  width: 200px;
  margin-left: 20px;
}
----

The https://web.dev/learn/css/[web.dev CSS tutorial, window=_blank] is helpful in learning the basics of CSS.

== Customizing Lumo Style Properties

The <<../lumo#, default Lumo theme>> is based on a set of <<../lumo/lumo-style-properties#, style properties>> -- CSS custom properties -- representing colors, fonts, sizes and other styles used by Vaadin components. These can be customized by providing new values for them in a CSS stylesheet, either globally, or <<#scoping-style-properties, scoped>> to a certain component type or instance.

To modify them globally -- for all components in the entire application -- place the value assignments in a CSS style block using the `html` selector:

[source,css]
----
html {
  --lumo-primary-color: green;
  --lumo-font-family: 'Roboto';
}
----

.Embedded Components
[NOTE]
====
If the theme is to be used with <<../../integrations/embedding#, embedded Flow applications or components>>, such as for use with <<{articles}/tools/dspublisher#, Design System Publisher>>, an additional `:host` selector must be used for global style property assignments: `html, :host { /* global styles */ }`
====


[#scoping-style-properties]
=== Style Properties Scoped to Specific Components

Style property assignments can be scoped to a specific component type, such as Buttons or Text Fields, by using the corresponding HTML element name as the selector:

[source,css]
----
vaadin-button {
  --lumo-primary-text-color: green;
}

vaadin-text-field {
  --lumo-font-family: 'Roboto';
}
----

You'll find the HTML element names for a component in the [guilabel]*Styling* page of each <<{articles}/components#, component>>.

Style property assignments can also be scoped to specific component instances, by applying CSS class names to the components with the `addClassName` method and adding them to the root element selector prefixed with a period:

[source,java]
----
Button specialButton = new Button("I'm special");
specialButton.addClassName("special");
----

[source,css]
----
vaadin-button.special {
  --lumo-primary-text-color: cyan;
}
----

.CSS Class Names
[NOTE]
CSS class names are identifier-attributes applied to HTML elements in order to scope CSS styling to them. The same class name can be applied to multiple elements, and each element can have multiple class names. They have nothing to do with Java or TypeScript classes.


=== Style Properties Scoped to Part of the UI

Style property values can also be applied to any container element, such as <<{articles}/components/horizontal-layout#,Horizontal Layout>> and <<{articles}/components/vertical-layout#,Vertical Layout>> or <<{articles}/create-ui/standard-html#, HTML elements>> like ``div``s, typically by applying CSS class names to them. All Vaadin components, as well as other child elements, automatically inherit style property values applied to their parent elements:

[source,java]
----
Button logOutButton = new Button("Log out");
HorizontalLayout appHeader = new HorizontalLayout(logOutButton);
appHeader.addClassName("app-header");
----

[source,css]
----
.app-header {
  /* This will be applied to the button and all other elements in the app-header */
  --lumo-primary-text-color: green;
}
----

This can be used to apply a unique set of style properties to specific views in the application, by applying a CSS class name to the view's root layout element, and scoping style property assignments to it.


[#styling-components-with-css]
== Applying Custom CSS

Vaadin components are more complex than native HTML elements due to the additional features they provide. They also utilize an HTML feature called https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM[_shadow DOM_, window=_blank], which encapsulates their internal HTML structure, and isolates it from the page's global CSS.

Because of this, even seemingly simple components like Text Fields and Buttons cannot be styled using native HTML element selectors like `input {...}` and `button {...}`. Instead, each component exposes a number of _parts_ and _states_ that can be used as selectors in CSS style blocks, that are listed in the [guilabel]*Styling* page of <<{articles}/components#,each component>>.

As an example, to apply a background color and a border to the actual _input field_ part of a Text Field – the gray area where text is entered – you need to target a shadow part called `input-field`, which can be styled using the `::part(input-field)` CSS selector, as shown below.

[source,css]
----
vaadin-text-field::part(input-field) {
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid gray;
}
----

Component styles can be placed in the master stylesheet, or any other stylesheet imported through it, in the <<../application-theme#, theme folder>>.

.`@CssImport` Supported, Not Recommended
[NOTE]
In older versions of Vaadin, stylesheets were loaded using `@CssImport` and `@Stylesheet` annotations – and in very old versions using the `@HtmlImport` annotation. While `@CssImport` and `@Stylesheet` still work, they are no longer recommended as the primary way to load styles for components.


=== Be Aware of States & Variants When Applying CSS

Custom CSS applied to a component can often override <<parts-and-states#state-attributes, state>> and <<parts-and-states#component-style-variants, variant>> styles built into the component. As an example, the following CSS changes the text color of _all_ Buttons, including the built-in _Primary_ style variant and the disabled state:

[source,css]
----
vaadin-button {
  color: red;
}
----

To only change the text color of _enabled_ buttons using the default style variant, you need to exclude those with the `:not()` selector:

.Style block that excludes disabled and primary buttons
[source,css]
----
vaadin-button:not([disabled]):not([theme~="primary"]) {
  color: red;
}
----
