In addition to the Lumo theme, Vaadin components include a built-in _Material_ theme, inspired by the original Material Design system by Google.

Although this theme is no longer actively developed, it is still supported in Vaadin 24 for legacy purposes, but not recommended for new applications.

The theme can be applied using the `@Theme` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Theme(themeClass = Material.class)
public class Application implements AppShellConfigurator {
    …
}
----

Like Lumo, it has a dark variant applied in a similar manner:

[source,java]
----
@Theme(themeClass = Material.class, variant = Material.DARK)
public class Application implements AppShellConfigurator {
    …
}
----

The Material theme can be customized using a set of style properties for typography and color.
