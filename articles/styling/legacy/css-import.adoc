= `@CssImport` Annotation

The `@CssImport` annotation was used in earlier versions of the Vaadin platform to load stylesheets into the application. It takes an optional `themeFor` parameter that can be used to inject CSS into the Shadow DOM of a Vaadin component by providing a string matching the component's root element name.

@CssImport("global-styles.css")
@CssImport(value = "text-field-styles.css, themeFor = "vaadin-text-field")
public class MyUI extends Div {
    …
}

Although this mechanism still works, the #application theme folder# is now the recommended approach for loading stylesheets. It also supports #injection of Shadow DOM styles# into Vaadin components through the `components` sub-folder.
