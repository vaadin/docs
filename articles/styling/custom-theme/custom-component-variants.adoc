= Custom Component Variants


Many Vaadin components have built-in <<{articles}/styling/lumo/variants/component-variants#, theme variants>> that provide different styles for the component.
Theme variants are similar to CSS class names, but are automatically inherited by sub-components within the component to which they are applied.


You can define your own component theme variants using component-specific style sheets in a <<{articles}/styling/custom-theme/creating-custom-theme#, custom theme>>.

.[filename]#vaadin-button.css#
[example,css]
----
:host([theme~="rounded"]) {
  border-radius: 1em;
}
----

You can then apply the theme variant similarly to the built-in variants:

[.example]
--

[source,java]
----
Button btn = new Button("Rounded");
btn.getThemeList().add("rounded");
----

[source,typescript]
----
<vaadin-button theme="rounded">Rounded</vaadin-button>
----
--

These are inherited to sub-components in a similar way to the built-in variants.


See <<{articles}/styling/custom-theme/styling-components#, Styling Components>> to learn how to target the internal parts of Vaadin components.
