.Designed for an older version of Vaadin
[NOTE]
The theme editor was designed for Vaadin 10, and hasn't yet been updated to support later versions out of the box.
The resulting CSS is still usable as-is in all versions.


== Where to Put the CSS

Instead of HTML imports and `<custom-style>`, which were used in earlier Vaadin versions, you should place the CSS in your <<{articles}/styling/custom-theme/creating-custom-theme#document-root-style-sheet, custom theme’s document root style sheet>>. For example, [filename]`frontend/themes/my-theme/document.css`.

The CSS inside the `"button-style"` and `"text-field-style"` `<dom-module>` elements (in the editor's output) should be placed in the corresponding <<{articles}/styling/custom-theme/creating-custom-theme#vaadin-component-styles, component style sheets>> in your custom theme.
For example, [filename]`frontend/themes/my-theme/components/vaadin-button.css` and [filename]`frontend/themes/my-theme/components/vaadin-text-field.css`.


== Feedback

The theme editor isn't an officially supported tool, but you can still let us know if you have any issues with it or wish us to develop it further.
