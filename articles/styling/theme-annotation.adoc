= @Theme Annotation

The `@Theme` annotation is used to define the theme to use for your application.
You can use it to enable one of Lumo's built-in light or dark themes, or to define your own custom theme.

Consider the following when you use the `@Theme` annotation:

* By default, Vaadin applications use the light variant of Lumo.
There is no need to use the `@Theme` annotation if you want to use this theme.
* The annotation should be present only once for an app, in a class implementing the `AppShellConfiguration` interface.
That is, only a single theme can be defined and having multiple instances will throw an exception.
* Custom themes declared using the `@Theme` annotation are always based on Lumo theme.
* You can use `@Theme` to declare a custom theme that is based on the light or dark variant of Lumo.

== Usage

The `@Theme` annotation must be added on a class that implements the `AppShellConfigurator` interface.

For example, in a Spring Boot application, you can explicitly enable Lumo's dark variant by implementing the `AppShellConfigurator` interface in the main `Application` class, and then adding the `@Theme` annotation to it:

.`Application.java`
[source, java]
----
@Theme(variant = Lumo.DARK) // <1>
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer implements AppShellConfigurator { // <2>

  public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
    
}
----
<1> The `@Theme` annotation can be used to enable one of Lumo's built-in light or dark variants, or to define your own custom theme.
In this example, the annotation is being used to enable Lumo's dark variant.
<2> The `@Theme` annotation can only be added once in the application on top of a class that implements the `AppShellConfigurator` interface.

In a plain-Java project, the annotation can be used in a class that looks something like the following:

.`Application.java`
[source, java]
----
@Theme("my-theme") // <1>
public class MyAppShell implements AppShellConfigurator { // <2>
}
----
<1> In this example, the `@Theme` annotation is used to declare a custom theme called `my-theme`. 
<2> The `@Theme` annotation must always be used on a class implementing `AppShellConfigurator`.

== Enabling Lumo Dark Mode

By default, Lumo uses the light variant of the theme.
You can enable the dark variant by using the `@Theme` annotation and setting the `variant` property to `Lumo.DARK`.

.`Application.java`
[source, java]
----
@Theme(variant = Lumo.DARK) // <1>
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer implements AppShellConfigurator {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
    
}

Read more about Lumo's light and dark modes in the <<{articles}/styling/lumo/variants#, Lumo variants>> guide.

== Declaring a Custom Theme

You can also use the `@Theme` annotation to declare a custom theme.

.`Application.java`
[source, java]
----
@Theme(value = "my-theme") // <1>
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer implements AppShellConfigurator {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
----
<1> The `@Theme` annotation is used to declare the name of the custom theme (in this case, the "my-theme" custom theme).
This custom theme will be applied on top of the default Lumo theme.

Note that custom themes are always based on the Lumo theme, which is in light mode by default. If you want to, you can use the `@Theme` annotation to declare a custom theme that is based on the dark variant of Lumo.

.`Application.java`
[source, java]
----
@Theme(value = "my-theme", variant = Lumo.DARK) // <1>
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer implements AppShellConfigurator {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
----
<1> The `@Theme` annotation is used to declare a custom theme called "my-theme" on top of the Lumo's dark variant.
