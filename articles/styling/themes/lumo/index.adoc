= Lumo

Lumo is the original Vaadin theme. It's based on a set of <<lumo-style-properties#, customizable style properties>>, and comes with built-in dark and compact variants.

The look and feel of all Vaadin components can be easily customized in a consistent manner across the entire application by supplying your own values to these style properties.

The built-in dark and compact variants are predefined sets of style property values that can be applied to the entire application or to parts of it.

The Lumo theme also includes a comprehensive set of CSS utility classes that can be applied to HTML elements and layout components through Java, to change their styling without writing any CSS of your own.


== Light & Dark Color Schemes

In the screenshot here, you can see the difference between the default light color variant on the left, and the dark variant on the right -- which are both built into Lumo.

See <<{articles}/styling/themes#color-schemes,Color Schemes>> for how to apply different color schemes in your application.


== Compact Preset

Lumo also has a compact preset that reduces fonts sizes -- and proportionally all Vaadin components. It's applied by loading an additional stylesheet containing a modified set of Lumo sizing properties:
