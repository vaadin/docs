For example, suppose that you want to style an application that has a bunch of Text Field, Combo Box, Date Picker, and Button components.
By default, they look as follows:

image::_images/textfield-combobox-datepicker-button.png["A Vaadin TextField, ComboBox, DatePicker, and Button with default look and feel"]

Suppose that you want to increase the roundness of their corners.
By default, the Lumo theme provides these components with a small rounded corner whose value is defined in the `--lumo-border-radius-m` variable.
To increase the roundness of the corners, you can override the default value of this variable.
Specifically, you can add the following inside the [filename]`styles.css` file to increase the default roundness value:


.`styles.css`
[source, css]
----
html {
    --lumo-border-radius-m: 1em;
}
----

This style increases the corner roundness of many components at once, so that they look similar to the following screenshot:

image::_images/rounded-textfield-combobox-datepicker-button.png["A Vaadin TextField, ComboBox, DatePicker, and Button with extra rounded corners"]

But what if one wants to override the defaults for only a subset of components? No problem; use the name of the components as the CSS selector.

For example, if one wants to override the rounded corner defaults for only the Text Field and Combo Box components, then the following should be added inside the [filename]`styles.css` file:


.`styles.css`
[source, css]
----
vaadin-text-field, vaadin-combo-box {
    --lumo-border-radius-m: 1em;
}
----

This changes the defaults for the Text Field and Combo Box only, leaving other components, such as the Date Picker and Button, with their default Lumo values.
