For example, suppose that we want to style an application that has a bunch of TextField, ComboBox, DatePicker, and Button components.
By default, they will look as follows:

image::_images/textfield-combobox-datepicker-button.png["A Vaadin TextField, ComboBox, DatePicker, and Button with default look and feel"]

Suppose that we want to increase the roundedness of their corners.
By default, the Lumo theme provides these components with a small rounded corner whose value is defined in the `--lumo-border-radius-m` variable.
In order to increase the roundedness of the corners, we can override the default value of this variable.
Specifically, we can add the following inside the [filename]#styles.css# file in order to increase the default roundedness value:


.`styles.css`
[source, css]
----
html {
    --lumo-border-radius-m: 1em;
}
----

This style will increase the corner roundedness of many components at once, so that they will look similar to the following screenshot:

image::_images/rounded-textfield-combobox-datepicker-button.png["A Vaadin TextField, ComboBox, DatePicker, and Button with extra rounded corners"]

But what if one wants to override the defaults for only a subset of components? No problem; simply use the name of the components as the CSS selector. 

For example, if one wants to override the rounded corner defaults for only the TextField and ComboBox components, then the following should be added inside the [filename]#styles.css# file:


.`styles.css`
[source, css]
----
vaadin-text-field, vaadin-combo-box {
    --lumo-border-radius-m: 1em;
}
----

This will change the defaults for the TextField and ComboBox only, leaving other components, such as the DatePicker and Button, with their default Lumo values.
