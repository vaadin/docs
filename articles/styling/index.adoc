= Styling Overview

This section contains a brief overview of the main aspects of styling Vaadin applications: how to customize the styling of Vaadin components; how to style other UI elements; and where to place your CSS code.

The other pages in the Styling section provide further details on these methods and other related topics.


== Customizing Component Styles

The look and feel of Vaadin components is highly customizable in several ways.


=== Built-in Style Variants

Many Vaadin components come with built-in *style variants* that can be used to change the color, size, or other visual aspects of individual component instances through the `addThemeVariants` Java API.

[.example]
--

[source,java]
----
<source-info group="Flow"></source-info>
Button btn = new Button("Save");
btn.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY);
----

[source,tsx]
----
<source-info group="React"></source-info>
<Button theme="primary">Save</Button>
----

[source,html]
----
<source-info group="Lit"></source-info>
<vaadin-button theme="primary">Save</vaadin-button>
----

--

See <<{articles}/components#, Browse Components>> for information on built-in style variants.


=== Customizing Style Properties

The default styling of Vaadin components is based on *style properties* -- customizable CSS values -- in the default Lumo theme. They can be used to tweak colors, fonts, sizing, and other properties without writing custom CSS.

.Lumo Style Properties Example
[.fill.white]
image::_images/lumo-properties.png[A small sample of Lumo style properties and their use in Vaadin components, 400]

Style properties can be customized by providing new values for them in a CSS stylesheet.

[source,css]
----
/* Global style values */
html {
  --lumo-primary-color: green;
  --lumo-font-family: "Roboto";
}

/* Scoped to a type of component */
vaadin-button {
  --lumo-font-family: "Courier";
}
----

.Effects of Above Customizations
[.fill.white]
image::_images/lumo-properties-tweaked.png[The effects of the above customizations, 400]

A style property value can have different scopes:

- *Global*, which affects the entire application. It’s applied to the `html` selector.
- *Component type* specific. It’s applied to the component’s root element selector
- *Component instances* – specific to one or more – to which a particular *CSS class name* has been applied (as shown below)

[.example]
--

[source,java]
----
<source-info group="Flow"></source-info>
Button specialButton = new Button("I'm special");
specialButton.addClassName("special");
----

[source,tsx]
----
<source-info group="React"></source-info>
<Button className="special">I'm special!</Button>
----

[source,html]
----
<source-info group="Lit"></source-info>
<vaadin-button class="special">I'm special!</vaadin-button>
----

--

[source,css]
----
/* Scoped to instances with a particular CSS class name */
vaadin-button.special {
  --lumo-primary-color: cyan;
}
----

Style properties are recommended as the primary approach to both Vaadin component style customization and custom CSS. They make it easier to achieve a consistent look and feel across the application.

See <<lumo/lumo-style-properties#, List of Lumo style properties>> and <<styling-components#styling-components-with-style-properties, Styling components through style properties>> for more information on these properties.


=== Applying CSS to Components

If you need to customize a component in ways that cannot be achieved with Lumo style properties, you can apply custom CSS to the component in a stylesheet.

Each component has a [guilabel]*Styling* documentation page that lists the CSS selectors to use for targeting the component, its parts, and its states.

.Some of the stylable parts of a Text Field component
[.fill.white]
image::_images/text-field-parts.png[Some of the stylable parts of a Text Field component, 500]

CSS is applied to components in regular CSS stylesheets, typically in the application theme folder.

.`frontend/themes/my-theme/styles.css`
[source,css]
----
vaadin-text-field::part(input-field) {
  border: 1px solid gray;
}

vaadin-text-field[focused]::part(input-field) {
  border-color: blue;
}
----

.Results of this CSS
[.fill.white]
image::_images/custom-styled-textfield.png[Effects of the above CSS]

CSS can be scoped to specific component instances by applying *CSS class names* to them.

[.example]
--

[source,java]
----
<source-info group="Flow"></source-info>
TextField specialTextField = new TextField("I'm special");
specialTextField.addClassName("special");
----

[source,tsx]
----
<source-info group="React"></source-info>
<TextField className="special">I'm special!</TextField>
----

[source,html]
----
<source-info group="Lit"></source-info>
<vaadin-text-field class="special">I'm special!</vaadin-text-field>
----

--

[source,css]
----
vaadin-text-field.special::part(input-field) {
  border-color: orange;
}
----

See <<styling-components#styling-components-with-css, Styling components with CSS>>, <<{articles}/components#, Browse components to see their CSS selectors>>, and <<styling-components/styling-component-instances#, Applying CSS to specific component instances# with CSS class names>> for more information.


== Styling Other UI Elements

Although Vaadin application UIs are built primarily using Vaadin components, native HTML elements, like `<span>` and `<div>`, are also often used for layout and custom UI structures. These can be styled with custom CSS, and with utility classes that bundle predefined styles as easy-to-use constants.


=== Applying CSS to HTML Elements

Custom CSS is applied to native HTML elements similarly to Vaadin components, by placing it in a stylesheet in the application theme folder. Styles can be scoped to individual instances of these elements by applying CSS class names to them.

[.example]
--
[source,java]
----
<source-info group="Flow"></source-info>
Span warning = new Span("This is a warning");
warning.addClassName("warning");
----
[source,tsx]
----
<source-info group="React"></source-info>
<span className="warning">This is a warning!</span>
----
[source,html]
----
<source-info group="Lit"></source-info>
<span class="warning">I'm special!</span>
----
--

.styles.css
[source,css]
----
span.warning {
  color: orange;
}
----

See <</flow/create-ui/standard-html#, Native HTML element classes in Flow>> and <<styling-other-elements#, Applying CSS to native HTML elements>> for more information.


=== Applying Styles with Utility Classes

The *Lumo Utility Classes* are a set of predefined CSS classes (similar to Tailwind CSS) that can be used to apply styling to HTML elements without writing your own CSS.

.Small sample of Lumo Utility Classes
[.fill.white]
image::_images/utility-classes.png[Small sample of Lumo Utility Classes, 300]

The `LumoUtility` collection in Flow provides constants for each utility class. They are applied the same way as other CSS classnames.

[.example]
--
[source,java]
----
<source-info group="Flow"></source-info>
Span errorMsg = new Span("Error");
errorMsg.addClassNames(
  LumoUtility.TextColor.ERROR,
  LumoUtility.Padding.SMALL,
  LumoUtility.Background.BASE,
  LumoUtility.BoxShadow.XSMALL,
  LumoUtility.BorderRadius.LARGE
);
----
[source,tsx]
----
<source-info group="React"></source-info>
<span className="text-error p-s bg-base shadow-xs rounded-l">Error</span>
----
[source,html]
----
<source-info group="Lit"></source-info>
<span class="text-error p-s bg-base shadow-xs rounded-l">Error</span>
----
--

[NOTE]
====
The Lumo utility classes are primarily designed to be used with native HTML elements, Vaadin layout components, and custom UI structures. Although some of them do work as expected on some Vaadin components, this is not their intended use. They can't be used to style the inner parts of components.
====

See <<lumo/utility-classes#, Lumo Utility Classes>> for more information.


== Locating & Loading Styles

Style property customizations and custom CSS are both placed in CSS stylesheets, typically in the application's theme folder. The theme folder is specified using the `@Theme` annotation.

A master stylesheet, named `styles.css`, is automatically loaded. If you wish to split your CSS into multiple stylesheets, these can be added via CSS `@import` directives in the master stylesheet.

.Theme folder location and structure
[source]
----
frontend
└── themes
    └── my-theme
        ├── styles.css
        └── theme.json
----

[source,java]
----
@Theme("my-theme")
public class Application implements AppShellConfigurator {
  ...
}
----

Note that application projects generated with *Vaadin Start* have a theme folder applied by default.

.Flow @CssImport Annotation
[NOTE]
In older versions of Vaadin, stylesheets were loaded using `@CssImport` and `@Stylesheet` annotations (and in very old versions using the `@HtmlImport` annotation). While `@CssImport `and `@Stylesheet` still work, they are only recommended for loading stylesheets into custom standalone components, not as the primary way to load application styles.

See <<application-theme#, Application theme folder>> for more information.
