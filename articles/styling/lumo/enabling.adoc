= Enabling Lumo

*There is no need to enable Lumo explicitly* as it is enabled by default for all Vaadin applications and components.

However, if you want to, you can do it explicitly using the `@Theme` annotation as follows:

[source, java]
----
@Theme(themeClass = Lumo.class)
----

Check this <<{articles}/styling/theme-annotation#, guide>> for more information on how to use the `@Theme` annotation.

Note that you can disable the Lumo theme for your application using the <<{articles}/styling/advanced/notheme-annotation#, `@NoTheme` annotation>>.
However, this is not recommended for most applications as it is easier to extend Lumo theme than to start from scratch.
