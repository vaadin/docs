= Enabling Lumo

*There is no need to enable Lumo explicitly* as it is enabled by default for all Vaadin applications and components.

However, if you want to, you can do it explicitly using the `@Theme` annotation as follows:

[source, java]
----
@Theme(themeClass = Lumo.class)
----

Check this <<{articles}/styling/theme-annotation#, guide>> for more information on how to use the `@Theme` annotation.
