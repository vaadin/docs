= Styling Your Application Using Lumo Design Tokens

The basic building blocks of the Lumo theme are a set of _design tokens_, which are essentially a set of CSS custom properties for things like colors, font sizes, and other typographic and layout settings.

The Lumo theme combines these design tokens to provide Vaadin applications and components with their default look and feel.


You can use Lumo design tokens to customize the style of your application.
However, before doing so, you should consider using one of the available built-in <<{articles}/styling/lumo/variants#, Lumo variants>>, which are themselves built on top of Lumo design tokens.
For example, you can use the Lumo dark mode variant to create a dark theme for your application.

You can use Lumo design tokens directly to customize the style of your application in two ways:

. By overriding the default values of the design tokens, thereby changing the look and feel of your application.
. Using the default design-token values as they are to style your application's custom views and components.

Lumo design tokens are also useful when you want to consistently style views and components.
For example, you can use the <<{articles}/styling/lumo/design-tokens/size-space#space, design tokens for spacing>> as a standard measure for your application.
You can, for instance, add a small margin around all views and components in your application by adding the following to a CSS style sheet:


[source,css]
----
* {
    margin: var(--lumo-space-xs);
}
----

You can also scope the styles to specific views and components by using specific CSS selectors.
For example, you can scope the above styles to Button components only by adding the following to a CSS style sheet:

[source,css]
----
vaadin-button {
    margin: var(--lumo-space-xs);
}
