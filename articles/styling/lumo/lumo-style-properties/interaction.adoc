= Lumo Interaction

== Cursor

Lumo defines a CSS custom property that you can use to adjust the way in which your application signals clickable elements to users of pointer devices -- typically a mouse.

You can either follow the _web_ approach and use the pointer (i.e., hand) cursor for clickable items, or take the _desktop_ approach and use the default (i.e., arrow) cursor.

== Pointer Focus Ring

By default, Vaadin components only show a focus ring when the user navigates using the keyboard. You can enable a focus ring for pointer devices by setting the `--lumo-input-field-pointer-focus-visible` custom property to `1`. Note that this only applies to components with an input field such as Text Field, Date Picker, etc.
