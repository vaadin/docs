= Lumo Theme

Lumo is the default theme for all Vaadin applications and components, which can be customized to fit your visual style requirements.

The core Lumo package defines the basic building blocks for component themes as CSS custom properties (also known as _design tokens_) such as colors, typography and other visual styles.
In addition to the custom properties, Lumo includes light and dark mode variants, as well as a compact mode variant.

*There is no need to enable Lumo explicitly* as it is enabled by default for all Vaadin applications and components.
However, if you want to, you can do it explicitly using the `@Theme` annotation as follows:

[source, java]
----
@Theme(themeClass = Lumo.class)
----

Check this <<{articles}/styling/theme-annotation#, guide>> for more information on how to use the `@Theme` annotation.

Note that you can disable the Lumo theme for your application using the <<{articles}/styling/advanced/notheme-annotation#, `@NoTheme` annotation>>.
However, this is not recommended for most applications as it is easier to extend the Lumo theme than to start from scratch.
