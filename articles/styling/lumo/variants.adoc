= Lumo Variants

Lumo has global variants that you can use to quickly customize all components in your application.
These global variants are:

* Light and dark mode themes
* Compact mode

In addition, many <<{articles}/components#, Vaadin components>> have their own built-in variants that can be used to style individual component instances quickly.
For example, the <<{articles}/components/button#, Button>> component has built-in Primary, Secondary, and Error/Danger variants (and more) that you can use to style individual instances of the button.

== Light and Dark Mode

Lumo light and dark mode variants can be used to quickly customize all components in your application.
By default, Lumo uses the light theme.

== Enable Dark Mode Permanently

To enable the dark mode permanently for the whole application, use the `@Theme` annotation, specifying the `variant` parameter to `Lumo.DARK`.

[source, java]
----
@Theme(variant = Lumo.DARK) 
----

== Dynamically Enable Light and Dark Mode

We often want to enable our application users to choose themselves between light and dark mode. 
For this we cannot use the `@Theme` annotation as it sets the variant permanently for the whole application.
Instead, we can use the `ThemeList` object of the UI to enable the user to choose between light and dark mode.
This approach is demonstrated in the following view:

[source, java]
----
@Route("")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    public MainView() {
        H1 h1 = new H1("Hello darkness");

        Button toggleButton = new Button("Toggle dark theme", click -> {
            ThemeList themeList = UI.getCurrent().getElement().getThemeList(); // <1>

            if (themeList.contains(Lumo.DARK)) { // <2>
                themeList.remove(Lumo.DARK);
            } else {
                themeList.add(Lumo.DARK);
            }
        });

        add(toggleButton, h1);
    }
}
----
<1> Get the list of currently applied theme variants.
<2> Toggle between the light and dark themes.

== Apply Light and Dark Mode to Specific Components

Using the `@Theme` annotation enables the dark mode for all components in your application.
You can also apply the light or dark mode to individual components using the Elements API as in the following example:

[source, java]
----
TextField darkTextField = new TextField();
darkTextField.getElement().setAttribute("theme", Lumo.DARK);
----

== Compact Mode

Lumo has a compact variant that reduce the font size and the sizing and spacing of all components, allowing you to place more components on the screen.
The compact variant is applied by importing an additional style sheet, which sets new values for the Typography, Sizing and Spacing CSS properties.

To enable the compact mode, use the `@JsModule` annotation as follows:

[source,java]
----
@JsModule("@vaadin/vaadin-lumo-styles/presets/compact.js") // <1>
public class Foo { // <2>
}
----
<1> Adding this `@JsModule` annotation enables the compact mode.
<2> Unlike the `@Theme` annotation, the `@JsModule` annotation does not have to be added to a class that implements the `AppShellConfigurator` interface.

== Components Built-in Variants

Many Vaadin components have built-in variants that can be used to style individual component instances quickly.
You can find those variants under each component page in the <<{articles}/components#, Vaadin components>> chapter of the documentation.

For example, the <<{articles}/components/button#, Button>> component has built-in Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary variants (among others) that you can use to style individual instances of the button.
By default, the button is styled with the Secondary variant.
You can enable the Primary or Tertiary variant of the button as follows:

[source,java]
----
Button primaryButton = new Button("Primary");
primaryButton.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY);

Button secondaryButton = new Button("Secondary"); // <1>

Button tertiaryButton = new Button("Tertiary");
tertiaryButton.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_TERTIARY);
----
<1> By default, the button is styled with the Secondary variant.
