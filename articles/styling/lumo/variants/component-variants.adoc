= Components Built-in Variants

Many Vaadin components have built-in variants that can be used to style individual component instances quickly.
You can find those variants under each component page in the <<{articles}/components#, Vaadin components>> chapter of the documentation.

For example, the <<{articles}/components/button#, Button>> component has built-in Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary variants (among others) that you can use to style individual instances of the button.
By default, the button is styled with the Secondary variant.
You can enable the Primary or Tertiary variant of the button as follows:

[source,java]
----
Button primaryButton = new Button("Primary");
primaryButton.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY);

Button secondaryButton = new Button("Secondary"); // <1>

Button tertiaryButton = new Button("Tertiary");
tertiaryButton.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_TERTIARY);
----
<1> By default, the button is styled with the Secondary variant.


Multiple theme variants can be simultaneously applied to a component, although not all variants are designed to be used together.

[source,java]
----
Button btn = new Button("Primary + Small");
btn.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY, ButtonVariant.LUMO_SMALL);
----
