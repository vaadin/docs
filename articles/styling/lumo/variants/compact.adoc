= Lumo Compact Mode

Lumo has a compact variant that reduces the font size and the sizing and spacing of all components, allowing you to place more components on the screen.
The compact variant is applied by importing an additional style sheet, which sets new values for the typography, sizing and spacing CSS properties.


To enable the compact mode, use the `@JsModule` annotation as follows:

[source,java]
----
@JsModule("@vaadin/vaadin-lumo-styles/presets/compact.js") // <1>
public class Foo { // <2>
}
----
<1> Adding this `@JsModule` annotation enables the compact mode.
<2> Unlike the `@Theme` annotation, the `@JsModule` annotation doesn't have to be added to a class that implements the [interfacename]`AppShellConfigurator` interface.
