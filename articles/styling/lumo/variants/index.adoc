= Lumo Variants

Lumo has global variants that you can use to quickly customize all components in your application.
These global variants are:

* Light and dark mode themes
* Compact mode

In addition, many <<{articles}/components#, Vaadin components>> have their own built-in variants that can be used to style individual component instances quickly.
For example, the <<{articles}/components/button#, Button>> component has built-in Primary, Secondary, and Error/Danger variants (and more) that you can use to style individual instances of the button.
