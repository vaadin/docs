= Routing with Spring

Routing works the same way with Spring as it does with a plain Flow application.
To be able to handle the default route you just define a component with `@Route("")` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class RootComponent extends Div {
    public RootComponent(){
        setText("Default path");
    }
}
----

In the same way you may define any other router path. See  
<<../routing/tutorial-routing-annotation#,Defining Routes with @Route>> 
tutorial and other router tutorials for more details about using router.

The only thing that is new here for Spring is the possibility to use dependency injection in the
components annotated with `@Route`. Such a component is instantiated by Spring
and becomes a Spring initialized bean. In particular it means that you may autowire
other Spring managed beans. Here is an example:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class RootComponent extends Div {
    
    public RootComponent(@Autowired DataBean dataBean){
        setText(dataBean.getMessage());
    }
}

public interface DataBean {
    String getMessage();
}

@Component
public class DataBeanImpl implements DataBean {

    public String getMessage(){
        return "message";
    }
}
----

You should be aware of the difference between running the application as a Spring Boot 
application and a WAR application deployed to a Web server. In the latter case 
all `@Route` annotations are discovered out of the box due to Servlet 3.0 specification. 
It doesn't happen automatically in the Spring Boot application case due to a design decision  
(see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/321).
Vaadin Spring add-on implements scanning for route classes (and other Vaadin
types that needs to be discovered and registered at startup) for Spring Boot applications for you.
But this scanning is done only inside Spring Boot application class package (the package
where `@SpringBootApplication` class is located). If your application contains 
route classes in packages that are not scanned by default then you have two options:
either move them into the `@SpringBootApplication` application class package 
(or its subpackages) or explicitly specify the packages where the scanning should 
discover the route classes. `@EnableVaadin` annotation allows you to do this via 
its `value` parameter.

[NOTE]
Normally you don't need to use the `@EnableVaadin` annotation at all with Spring Boot.
The annotation is intended to be used in Spring MVC case where it enables 
the Vaadin configuration. In Spring Boot case auto-configuration is available
which makes it work out of the box. So the only reason why you need to use 
`@EnableVaadin` is specifying the packages to scan.
