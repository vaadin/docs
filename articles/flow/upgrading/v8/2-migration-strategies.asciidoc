= Migration Strategies

For any existing Vaadin 8 application, it might be desirable to extend the lifetime of the application and make it possible to add new features using later Vaadin versions.
There are several migration strategies to consider as the need for migration is always application and business specific.

== Using Multiplatform Runtime

Multiplatform Runtime (MPR) is an officially supported Vaadin product, which makes it possible to run views and components from your Vaadin 8 applications inside later Vaadin versions.
This helps you migrate your application to a new version bit by bit, or incrementally add new features while also including existing application features as-is.

Using MPR, you will be able to get your Vaadin 8 applications running inside of a new Vaadin application after a couple of quick steps.
Then you can migrate the necessary parts while having a working application after each step.

See the <<{articles}/tools/mpr/overview#, Multiplatform Runtime documentation>> for more information.

== Transform an Existing Application

Transforming a Vaadin 8 app to a later Vaadin version by reusing backend interaction, business logic, and as much as possible of UI logic,
but updating the UI to use brand new components. When planning this migration, you should at a minimum read through all of
this documentation to understand the differences and verify what features are available and what you need to redesign.
One big benefit is that the Data APIs, `Binder` and `DataProvider`, work the same way in later versions, so you won't have to rework your backend integration.

== Fresh Start by Redesigning Your Application

Sometimes the best approach is to make a fresh start - this way you will be able to focus on using new features to deliver value to your users,
instead of carrying over legacy code. As mentioned in previous topics, there is still probably some opportunities to reuse
existing solutions related to integration to your business logic and backend.

== Migration Assessment Service

To help you understand what migrating to a new Vaadin version means to you, Vaadin offers an assessment service led by Vaadin experts. During the assessment, our experts will gain an understanding of your organization's objectives and concerns, and analyze your application code. http://pages.vaadin.com/vaadin-application-assessment-for-migration?utm_campaign=V10%20migration&utm_source=docs[Read more about the service].
