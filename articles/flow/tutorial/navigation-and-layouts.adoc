= Navigating Views in Vaadin

So far in this tutorial series, you've built a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application for listing and editing contacts. Now, you'll add a dashboard view to the application. You'll also add a responsive application layout, with a header and a navigation sidebar that can be toggled on small screens (see the screenshot here).

== View Routes

You can make any Vaadin component a navigation target by adding an `@Route("<path>")` annotation. Routes can be nested by defining the parent layout in the annotation: `@Route(value = "list", layout=MainLayout.class)`.


== Parent Layout

The application should have a shared parent layout with two child views. The first, `MainLayout`: App Layout should have a header and navigation: `ListView`: the default view, mapped to `""`; and `DashboardView`: mapped to `"dashboard"`. The second child should have a responsive application layout and navigation links.

Begin by creating a new Java class named [classname]`MainLayout` in the `views` package with the following content. This is the shared parent layout of both views in the application.

.`MainLayout.java`
[source, java]
----
package com.example.application.views;

import com.example.application.views.list.ListView;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.applayout.AppLayout;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.applayout.DrawerToggle;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.html.H1;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.orderedlayout.FlexComponent;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.orderedlayout.HorizontalLayout;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.orderedlayout.VerticalLayout;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.HighlightConditions;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.RouterLink;
import com.vaadin.flow.theme.lumo.LumoUtility;

public class MainLayout extends AppLayout { // <1>

    public MainLayout() {
        createHeader();
        createDrawer();
    }

    private void createHeader() {
        H1 logo = new H1("Vaadin CRM");
        logo.addClassNames(
            LumoUtility.FontSize.LARGE, // <2>
            LumoUtility.Margin.MEDIUM);

        var header = new HorizontalLayout(new DrawerToggle(), logo ); // <3>

        header.setDefaultVerticalComponentAlignment(FlexComponent.Alignment.CENTER); // <4>
        header.setWidthFull();
        header.addClassNames(
            LumoUtility.Padding.Vertical.NONE,
            LumoUtility.Padding.Horizontal.MEDIUM);

        addToNavbar(header); // <5>

    }

    private void createDrawer() {
        addToDrawer(new VerticalLayout( // <6>
                new RouterLink("List", ListView.class)  // <7>
        ));
    }
}
----
<1> `AppLayout` is a Vaadin layout with a header and a responsive drawer.
<2> Instead of styling the text with raw CSS, use <<{articles}/styling/lumo/utility-classes#,Lumo Utility Classes>> shipped with the default theme.
<3> `DrawerToggle` is a menu button that toggles the visibility of the sidebar.
<4> Centers the components in the `header` along the vertical axis.
<5> Adds the `header` layout to the application layout's nav bar, the section at the top of the screen.
<6> Wraps the router link in a `VerticalLayout` and adds it to the `AppLayout` drawer.
<7> Creates a `RouterLink` with the text "List" and `ListView.class` as the destination view.

RouterLink automatically maintains the `highlight` attribute currently active in the element, but there is no default styling for it. Add the following CSS to [filename]`frontend/themes/flowcrmtutorial/styles.css` to highlight the selected link.

.`styles.css`
[source,css]
----
a[highlight] {
    font-weight: bold;
    text-decoration: underline;
}
----

Lastly, in [classname]`ListView`, update the `@Route` mapping to use the new `MainLayout` like so:

.`ListView.java`
[source,java]
----
@Route(value="", layout = MainLayout.class) // <1>
@PageTitle("Contacts | Vaadin CRM")
public class ListView extends VerticalLayout {
     ...
}
----
<1> [classname]`ListView` still matches the empty path, but now uses `MainLayout` as its parent.

Now you're ready to run the application. When you do, you should now see a header and a sidebar on the list view.

== Dashboard View

Next, you'll create a new dashboard view. It'll show some basic statistics: the number of contacts in the system, and a pie chart of the number of contacts per company.

image::images/navigation/dashboard-view.png[Dashboard view]

Now create a new Java class named [classname]`DashboardView` in the `views` package with the following content:

.`DashboardView.java`
[source,java]
----
package com.example.application.views;

import com.example.application.services.CrmService;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.Component;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.charts.Chart;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.charts.model.ChartType;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.charts.model.DataSeries;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.charts.model.DataSeriesItem;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.html.Span;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.orderedlayout.VerticalLayout;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.PageTitle;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.Route;
import com.vaadin.flow.theme.lumo.LumoUtility;

@Route(value = "dashboard", layout = MainLayout.class) // <1>
@PageTitle("Dashboard | Vaadin CRM")
public class DashboardView extends VerticalLayout {
    private final CrmService service;

    public DashboardView(CrmService service) { // <2>
        this.service = service;
        addClassName("dashboard-view");
        setDefaultHorizontalComponentAlignment(Alignment.CENTER); // <3>
        add(getContactStats(), getCompaniesChart());
    }

    private Component getContactStats() {
        Span stats = new Span(service.countContacts() + " contacts"); // <4>
        stats.addClassNames(
            LumoUtility.FontSize.XLARGE,
            LumoUtility.Margin.Top.MEDIUM);
        return stats;
    }

    private Chart getCompaniesChart() {
        Chart chart = new Chart(ChartType.PIE);

        DataSeries dataSeries = new DataSeries();
        service.findAllCompanies().forEach(company ->
            dataSeries.add(new DataSeriesItem(company.getName(), company.getEmployeeCount()))); // <5>
        chart.getConfiguration().setSeries(dataSeries);
        return chart;
    }
}
----
<1> [classname]`DashboardView` is mapped to the `"dashboard"` path and uses `MainLayout` as a parent layout.
<2> Takes [classname]`CrmService` as a constructor parameter and saves it as a field.
<3> Centers the contents of the layout.
<4> Calls the service to get the number of contacts.
<5> Calls the service to get all companies, then creates a [classname]`DataSeriesItem` for each, containing the company name and employee count. Don't worry about the compilation error, the missing method is added in the next step.

.Vaadin Charts is Commercial

Open [filename]`Company.java` and add the following field and getter to get the employee count without having to fetch all of the entities.
// TODO refactor this at some point. Probably not a good approach to suggest as all Company loads now do an extra query...

.`Company.java`
[source,java]
----
@Formula("(select count(c.id) from Contact c where c.company_id = id)") // <1>
private int employeeCount;

public int getEmployeeCount(){
    return employeeCount;
}
----
<1> The Formula is a Hibernate feature that allows you to specify SQL snippets to fetch special fields. The query gets the count of employees without needing to fetch all of the employees. Note that in a larger application you'll probably want to do this in some alternative way since all `Company` entity loads now triggers an additional SQL query, even though the `employeeCount` field is only needed in this `DashboardView` class.


== Dashboard View in Main Layout Sidebar

To include a dashboard view in the main layout side base, add a navigation link to [classname]`DashboardView` in the `MainLayout` drawer:

.`MainLayout.java`
[source,java]
----
private void createDrawer() {
    addToDrawer(new VerticalLayout(
            new RouterLink("List", ListView.class),
            new RouterLink("Dashboard", DashboardView.class)
    ));
}
----

Build and run the application again. You should now be able to navigate to the dashboard view and see stats on your CRM contacts. If you want, add or remove contacts in the list view to see that the dashboard reflects your changes.

On the next part of this tutorial, you'll secure the application by adding a log-in screen.
