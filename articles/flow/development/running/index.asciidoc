= Running an Application

[.lead]
Once you have imported an application in your IDE, you are ready to run it.
Vaadin starter applications are Spring Boot applications, which can be run like ordinary Java applications.

With a Spring Boot application like the ones created with *Start Vaadin*, you simply need to run the [classname]#Application# class in the project.
That launches an embedded server to run the application.

See how to do that in your IDE: <<eclipse#, Eclipse>>, <<intellij#, IntelliJ>>, or <<netbeans#, NetBeans>>.

Many IDEs also support debugging Java applications.
Debugging goes like normally running an application, but you need to do it in debug mode in the IDE.

== Running with Maven

During development, you can run a Vaadin application in an embedded web server by executing one of the Maven goals:

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
| Technology Stack | Embedded Server | Goal to Run
| Spring Boot | â€“ | `spring-boot:run`
| CDI / Java EE | Apache TomEE | `tomee:run`
| Plain Java | Jetty | `jetty:run`
|===

== Debugging

Many IDEs also support debugging Java applications.
Debugging goes like normally running an application, but you need to do it in debug mode in the IDE.

.Debugging Spring Boot applications
[NOTE]
You can debug Spring Boot applications by running them as Java applications, but not with Maven with `spring-boot:run`.
The Maven goal starts the application in a separate process, so you can not debug it.
