To function, components such as the `Grid` and `ComboBox` require that the assigned items have identifiers that are _stable_ and _unique_.
This usually requires a proper implementation of the [methodname]`hashCode()` and [methodname]`equals()` methods as described in the <<{articles}/flow/binding-data/data-provider#data-binding.data-provider.item-identifiers, section>>.
