= Data Binding

Vaadin Flow includes mechanisms to bind field components, as well as forms consisting of fields directly to business objects (e.g., Java beans). Binding is buffered, so you can load and reload data from the source to fields, and then save the edited data back.

This example has a view with two editors, one writable, one read-only. When the user clicks *Save*, the form data is written to the [classname]`BusinessPerson` object, which is reflected in the read-only form.

Field and form input can be validated before saving.
Additionally, when loading and saving, the data representation may need to be converted between the field type and the underlying data types in the business objects.
