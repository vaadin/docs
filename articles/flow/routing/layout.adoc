= Router Layouts & Nested Router Targets

All parent layouts of a navigation target component have to implement the [interfacename]`RouterLayout` interface. You can define a parent layout by adding the [annotationname]`@Layout` annotation to the class, or by using the optional element `layout` from the `@Route` annotation.


[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.5"]
=== Automatic Layout Using `@Layout`

The value for the [annotationName]`@Layout` annotation path has to be unique for the project. Otherwise, the resolver won't be able to determine which layout component should be used. Having multiple [annotationName]`@Layout` annotations with the same path throws an exception.

The example below renders all routes inside [classname]`MainLayout`:

[source,java]
----
@Layout
public class MainLayout extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
}
----

If the application is using access protection, the view access is checked for the Layout, as well as the view. To make the layout accessible, add [annotationname]`@AnonymousAllowed` -- or some other access annotation -- on the `MainLayout` so that the request is not denied.

[annotationname]`@Route` and [annotationname]`@RouteAlias` each contain an annotation attribute called, `autoLayout`. Setting that attribute to false will stop automatic layout; it will ignore any [annotationname]`@Layout` matching the route. Giving a class for the `layout` method in [annotationname]`@Route` also disables automatic layout and uses the one given.

.Ignore Automatic Layout
[source,java]
----
@Route(autoLayout = false)
public class NoLayoutView extends Div {
}

@Route(layout = MyLayout.class)
public class DefinedLayoutView extends Div {
}
----


=== Defining a Layout in `@Route`

This next example renders [classname]`CompanyComponent` inside [classname]`MainLayout` by defining the layout for the route:

[source,java]
----
@Tag("div")
@Route(value = "company", layout = MainLayout.class)
public class CompanyComponent extends Component {
}
----

When using the <<route#,`@Route("path")`>> annotation to define a route, the component renders by default in the `<body>` tag on the page when there is no `@Layout` for `RouterLayout`. This is because the element returned by [methodname]`HasElement.getElement()` is attached to the `<body>` tag.


[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.5"]
=== Layout Matching Routes

To configure which routes a [annotationname]`@Layout` annotated [classname]`RouterLayout` handles, the prefix of the route's path can be given for the value. 

The example below gives a value of `/user`, which would match the routes `/user` and `/user/info`:

[source,java]
----
@Layout(value="/user")
----

The default value is `/`, which matches all paths.


=== Multiple Router Target Components

Where multiple router target components use the same parent layout, the parent layout instances remain the same when the user navigates among the child components.

See <<page-titles#,Updating Page Title on Navigation>> for more information on this.


=== Multiple Parent Layouts

Use the `@ParentLayout` annotation to define a parent layout for components in the routing hierarchy. Where necessary, a parent can have its own parent layout.

In the example below, `MainLayout` is used for everything, which `MenuBar` is reused for views:

[source,java]
----
public class MainLayout extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
}

@Layout
@ParentLayout(MainLayout.class)
public class MenuBar extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
    public MenuBar() {
        addMenuElement(TutorialView.class, "Tutorial");
        addMenuElement(IconsView.class, "Icons");
    }
    private void addMenuElement(
            Class<? extends Component> navigationTarget,
            String name) {
        // implementation omitted
    }
}

@Route(value = "tutorial")
public class TutorialView extends Div {
}

@Route(value = "icons")
public class IconsView extends Div {
}
----

`MainLayout` encapsulates `MenuBar`, which in turn encapsulates `TutorialView` or `IconsView` -- depending on where the user has navigated.


== ParentLayout Route Control

Annotating a parent layout with `@RoutePrefix("prefix_to_add")` adds a prefix to its children's route.

In the example here, `PathComponent` receives the `some` prefix from its parent, resulting in `some/path` as its final route:

[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "path", layout = SomeParent.class)
public class PathComponent extends Div {
    // Implementation omitted
}

@RoutePrefix("some")
public class SomeParent extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
    // Implementation omitted
}
----


=== Absolute Routes

A child component can bypass the parent's route prefix by adding `absolute = true` to its own `@Route` or `@RoutePrefix` annotations.

This generic example builds a [classname]`MyContent` class to add "something" to multiple places in the `SomeParent` layout, without adding the route prefix to the navigation path:

[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "content", layout = SomeParent.class,
       absolute = true)
public class MyContent extends Div {
    // Implementation omitted
}
----

Even though the full path would typically be `some/content`, the result is only `content` because it has been defined as "absolute".

The example here defines `absolute = true` in the middle of the chain:

[source,java]
----
@RoutePrefix(value = "framework", absolute = true)
@ParentLayout(SomeParent.class)
public class FrameworkSite extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
    // Implementation omitted
}

@Route(value = "tutorial", layout = FrameworkSite.class)
public class Tutorials extends Div {
    // Implementation omitted
}
----

The bound route is `framework/tutorial`, although the full chain is `some/framework/tutorial`.

If a parent layout defines a `@RoutePrefix`, the "default" child could have its route defined as `@Route("")` and be mapped to the parent layout route. For example, `Tutorials` with route `""` would be mapped as `framework/`.
