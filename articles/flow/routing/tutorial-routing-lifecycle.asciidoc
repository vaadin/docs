= Navigation Lifecycle

A number of lifecycle events will be fired while applying navigation from one state to another.
The events are fired to listeners added to the `UI` instance and to attached components that implement special _observer_ interfaces.

== BeforeLeaveEvent
The first event fired during navigation is `BeforeLeaveEvent`.
The event allows delaying or canceling the navigation, or changing the navigation to instead go to a different destination.

This event will be delivered to any component instance that implements `BeforeLeaveObserver` and was attached to the UI before the navigation starts.
It is also possible to register a standalone listener for this event using the `addBeforeLeaveListener(BeforeLeaveListener)` method in `UI`.

One typical use case for this event is to ask the user whether they want to save any unsaved changes before navigating to some other part of the application.

[#postpone]
=== Postpone
`BeforeLeaveEvent` has a `postpone` method, which can be used to postpone
the current navigational transition until a specific condition is met.

E.g. the client may request the user's confirmation before leaving the page:
[source,java]
----
public class SignupForm extends Div implements BeforeLeaveObserver {
    @Override
    public void beforeLeave(BeforeLeaveEvent event) {
        if (this.hasChanges()) {
            ContinueNavigationAction action = event.postpone();
            ConfirmDialog.build("Are you sure you want to leave this page?")
                    .ifAccept(action::proceed).show();
        }
    }

    private boolean hasChanges() {
        // no-op implementation
        return true;
    }
}
----
Postponing interrupts the process of notifying observers and listeners.
When the transition is resumed, the remaining observers after the one which initiated the postpone will be called.
As an example, let's assume the current page has 3 observers __a__, __b__ and __c__,
which are being notified in this order. If __b__ calls `postpone`, the call to __c__,
as well as the rest of the transition process, is deferred. If the transition
postponed by __b__ is not resumed, __c__ will not get a notification about this
event at all and the transition never finishes. If, however, __b__ executes its
`ContinueNavigationAction` to resume the transition, it is continued from
where it was interrupted. Thus __a__ and __b__ are not called again, but __c__ is notified.

[NOTE]
At most one navigation event may be postponed at any time; starting a new
navigation transition while a previous one is in a postponed state obsoletes
the postponed state. After that, executing the `ContinueNavigationAction` kept
from earlier will have no effect.

== BeforeEnterEvent

The second event fired during navigation is `BeforeEnterEvent`.
It allows changing the navigation to instead go to a different destination.
This event is typically used for reacting to special situations such as if there is no data to show or if the user doesn't have appropriate permissions.

The event is fired only after any `postpone` through `BeforeLeaveEvent` has been continued.

This event will be delivered to any component instance implementing `BeforeEnterObserver` that will be attached to the UI after navigation completes.
Note that the event is fired before detaching and attaching components to make the UI match the location being navigated to.
It is also possible to register a standalone listener for this event using the `addBeforeEnterListener(BeforeEnterListener)` method in `UI`.

[#reroute]
=== Reroute
Either `BeforeEnterEvent` or `BeforeLeaveEvent` can be used to reroute dynamically if there is a need to show completely different information in some state.
The event will not be fired any further listeners or observers after `reroute`.
Instead, a new navigation phase will be triggered based on the new navigation target, and events will be fired based on that navigation instead.

In this example the reroute would happen when entering `BlogList` without any results.
[source,java]
----
@Route("no-items")
public class NoItemsView extends Div {
    public NoItemsView() {
        setText("No items found.");
    }
}

@Route("blog")
public class BlogList extends Div implements BeforeEnterObserver {
    @Override
    public void beforeEnter(BeforeEnterEvent event) {
        // implementation omitted
        Object record = getItem();

        if (record == null) {
            event.rerouteTo(NoItemsView.class);
        }
    }

    private Object getItem() {
        // no-op implementation
        return null;
    }
}
----
[NOTE]
`rerouteTo` has several overloads to serve different use cases.

== AfterNavigationEvent

The third and last fired event during navigation is `AfterNavigationEvent`.
This event is typically used for updating various parts of the UI once the actual navigation has been completed.
Examples of this include adjusting the contents of a breadcrumb component and visually marking the active entry in a menu as active.

The event is fired after `BeforeEnterEvent` and updating which UI components are attached.
At this point, it can be expected that the current navigation state will actually be shown to the user, i.e. there will not be any further reroutes or similar.

This event will be delivered to any component instance implementing `AfterNavigationObserver` that is attached after completing the navigation.
It is also possible to register a standalone listener for this event using the `addAfterNavigationListener(AfterNavigationListener)` method in `UI`.

[source,java]
----
public class SideMenu extends Div implements AfterNavigationObserver {
    Anchor blog = new Anchor("blog", "Blog");

    @Override
    public void afterNavigation(AfterNavigationEvent event) {
        boolean active = event.getLocation().getFirstSegment()
                .equals(blog.getHref());
        blog.getElement().getClassList().set("active", active);
    }
}
