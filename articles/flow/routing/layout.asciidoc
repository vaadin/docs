= Router Layouts and Nested Router Targets


== RouterLayout Interface

All parent layouts of a navigation target component must implement the `RouterLayout` interface.

You can define a parent layout using the `Route.layout()` method.

*Example*: Render `CompanyComponent` inside `MainLayout`:

[source,java]
----
@Tag("div")
@Route(value = "company", layout = MainLayout.class)
public class CompanyComponent extends Component {
}
----

[NOTE]
When using the <<overview#,`@Route("path")`>> annotation to define a route, the component by default renders in the `<body>` tag on the page. This is because the element returned by `HasElement.getElement()` is attached to the `<body>` tag.


=== Multiple Router Target Components

Where multiple router target components use the same parent layout, the parent layout instances remain the same when the user navigates between the child components.

See <<page-titles#,Updating Page Title on Navigation>> for more.

=== Multiple Parent Layouts

Use the `@ParentLayout` annotation to define a parent layout for components in the routing hierarchy.

You can create a parent layout for a parent layout, where necessary.

*Example*: `MainLayout` used for everything and `MenuBar` reused for views:

[source,java]
----
public class MainLayout extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
}

@ParentLayout(MainLayout.class)
public class MenuBar extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
    public MenuBar() {
        addMenuElement(TutorialView.class, "Tutorial");
        addMenuElement(IconsView.class, "Icons");
    }
    private void addMenuElement(
            Class<? extends Component> navigationTarget,
            String name) {
        // implementation omitted
    }
}

@Route(value = "tutorial", layout = MenuBar.class)
public class TutorialView extends Div {
}

@Route(value = "icons", layout = MenuBar.class)
public class IconsView extends Div {
}
----

* `MainLayout` encapsulates `MenuBar`, which in turn encapsulates
`TutorialView` or `IconsView` depending on where the user has navigated to.


== ParentLayout Route Control

A parent layout can supplement the navigation route by adding to the route location.

This is done by annotating the parent layout with `@RoutePrefix("prefix_to_add")`

*Example*: `PathComponent` receives the `some/path` route.

[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "path", layout = SomeParent.class)
public class PathComponent extends Div {
    // Implementation omitted
}

@RoutePrefix("some")
public class SomeParent extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
    // Implementation omitted
}
----


=== Absolute Routes

You can use same parent component in many parts, without using a `@RoutePrefix` from the parent chain, or by only using it in defined parts.

This is done by adding `absolute = true` to either the `@Route` or `@RoutePrefix` annotations.

*Example*: Building a `MyContent` class to add "something" to multiple places in the `SomeParent` layout, without adding the route prefix to the navigation path:

[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "content", layout = SomeParent.class,
       absolute = true)
public class MyContent extends Div {
    // Implementation omitted
}
----

* Even though the full path would typically be `some/content`, we actually get only `content` because it has been defined as `absolute`.


*Example*: Defining `absolute` in the middle of the chain.

[source,java]
----
@RoutePrefix(value = "framework", absolute = true)
@ParentLayout(SomeParent.class)
public class FrameworkSite extends Div
        implements RouterLayout {
    // Implementation omitted
}

@Route(value = "tutorial", layout = FrameworkSite.class)
public class Tutorials extends Div {
    // Implementation omitted
}
----

* The bound route is `framework/tutorial` even though the full chain is `some/framework/tutorial`.

* If a parent layout defines a `@RoutePrefix`, the "default" child could have its route defined as `@Route("")` and be mapped to the parent layout route. For example, in the case of `Tutorials` with route `""` it would be mapped as `framework/`.
