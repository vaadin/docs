= Getting Registered Routes

To retrieve all registered `Routes`, use:

[source,java]
----
List<RouteData> routes = RouteConfiguration.forSessionScope().getAvailableRoutes();
----

* The [classname]`RouteData` object contains all the relevant information about the defined route, such as the route template, parameters, and parent layouts.

== Getting Registered Routes by Parent Layout

To retrieve all the routes defined by parent layout, use:

[source,java]
----
List<RouteData> routes = RouteConfiguration.forSessionScope().getAvailableRoutes();
List<RouteData> myRoutes = routes.stream()
        .filter(routeData -> MyParentLayout.class.equals((routeData.getParentLayout())))
        .toList();
