= Routing and Navigation

Vaadin provides the `Router` class to structure the navigation of your web application into logical parts.

The router takes care of serving content when the user navigates within an application.
It includes support for nested routes, access to route parameters and more.

The user navigates by interacting with UI elements such as buttons and menus.
When this occurs, the interaction needs to be mapped to a particular route.
