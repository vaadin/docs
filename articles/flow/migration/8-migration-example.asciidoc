= Migration example - Bookstore Starter

This document shows an example migration from a V8 app to Vaadin Flow. The
migration process is done step-by-step and can be seen through the history
of its https://github.com/vaadin/bookstore-starter-flow[GitHub repository].
The idea is to keep the application compilable in
order to be able to see the result of migrating steps.

== Step 1 - Initial Vaadin Flow configuration

=== Maven

First of all, required maven dependency must be added to pom.xml. The
Vaadin 8 dependencies, except `vaadin-themes`, are kept for now and will be eliminated after the
whole application is migrated. The only Vaadin platform dependency is the
following:
[source, xml]
....
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
   <artifactId>vaadin-core</artifactId>
   <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
....

In this document, migrating custom components and extensions is not
covered. So, the widgetset module that includes the following extensions
is removed.

* `AttributeExtension`
* `ResetButtonForTextField`

=== UI class and Servlet configuration

* Both `UI` class and Servlet configuration are optional in Vaadin Flow.
However, we can keep them to leverage them in some cases e.g.
controlling user access.
* Since the components are different, the DOM structure has changed. The
new components are based on web components and a new theme. Thus the
theming is discussed later.
* In Vaadin Flow the locale is set automatically based on user preferred
locale. So, `setLocale` can be removed.
* Best practice for setting page title is using `PageTitle` annotation on
each view. So, `getPage().setTitle` is removed from `MyUI::init`.
* All packages names in Vaadin Flow start with `com.vaadin.flow`. One way
to correct them is to remove all `import` statements starting
by `com.vaadin` and reimport Vaadin Flow classes. For example some
equivalent classes in Vaadin Flow are:

* `com.vaadin.ui.UI` → `com.vaadin.flow.component.UI`
* `com.vaadin.server.VaadinRequest` → `com.vaadin.flow.server.VaadinRequest`
* `com.vaadin.ui.TextField` →
`com.vaadin.flow.component.textfield.TextField`
* `com.vaadin.ui.VerticalLayout` →
`com.vaadin.flow.component.orderedlayout.VerticalLayout`

=== Test page

In order to verify that Vaadin Flow setup has been done correctly, a
simple `HelloWorldPage` like the following can be added.

[source, java]
----
import com.vaadin.flow.component.html.Div;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.html.H1;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.PageTitle;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.Route;

@Route("")
@PageTitle("My")
public class HelloWorldPage extends Div {
   public HelloWorldPage() {
       this.add(new H1("Hello World!"));
   }
}
----

`@Route(“”)` shows that root path should be routed to this page. After
running the application by `mvn jetty:run`, the “Hello World!” message can
be seen in the browser by entering this address:
http://127.0.0.1:8080[http://127.0.0.1:8080].

https://github.com/vaadin/bookstore-starter-flow/commit/be5a5e0c48de7ee5cca5fafb1abad93ccabe1cd4[Here] is
the link to the repository after the first step.

== Step 2 - Access Control and Login Screen

=== VaadinServletConfiguration and UI class

In Vaadin Flow, defining a Servlet class is optional. So, we don’t have to
create an extended class of `VaadinServlet`, unless we need to change some
configuration. Having a `UI` class is optional too and this class can be
removed as well, because the `UI` class is created by the framework.
However, we may have some tasks assigned to our `UI` class e.g.
controlling access. In this example access control is moved to a more
suitable place which is described in the following section.

=== Access Control

`BeforeEnter` event of `UI` class is a good place to control access and
there is another event named `UIInit` in `VaadinService` class that is fired
whenever a `UI` is created. In order to leverage these events, we can
create a class extended from
https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/advanced/tutorial-service-init-listener.html[VaadinServiceInitListener] and
add required code in `serviceInit` method. The result looks like the
following piece of code:

[source, java]
----
public class BookstoreInitListener implements VaadinServiceInitListener {
   @Override
   public void serviceInit(ServiceInitEvent initEvent) {
       initEvent.getSource().addUIInitListener(uiInitEvent -> {
           uiInitEvent.getUI().addBeforeEnterListener(enterEvent -> {
               // Controlling access can be done here.
           });
       });
   }
}
----

`MyUI` class had an instance of `BasicAccessControl` and other classes used
it via its accessor; now after `MyUI` class is eliminated, there must be
another provider for `AccessControl` implementation. The selected solution
here is using a factory class (`AccessControlFactory`).

`CurrentUser` class is also needed to change because it is used in
`BasicAccessControl` class. We need to apply new packages names of Flow that start with `com.vaadin.flow`. The same should be done in next
steps of migration.

=== LoginScreen

This is the first `UI` screen migrated to Flow. The following items
describe what needs to be done in migration process:

* Instead of `CssLayout` another equivalent component must be used e.g.
`FlexLayout` or a simple `Div`.
* Equivalent of `addComponent` method is `add` method.
* `setWidth` method in Flow has only one `String` parameter that
includes both measurement unit and width as a number e.g. “15em” or
“310px”.
* `Route` annotation determines the url associated with this screen.
* In order to add a theme variant in V10,
`getElement().getThemeList().add(String)` is used. Although theme variant is
different from style name, the former can be considered as the successor of the
latter. So, `addStyleName(String)` can be replaced with
`getElement().getThemeList().add(String)`. However, in V12 `addThemeVariants(...)`
API was reintroduced for generated components. Changes in theming from V8 to Vaadin
platform is described link:6-theming.html[here].
* New `FormLayout` has a method named `addFormItem` takes a component as a
parameter and in addition to adding it to the form, it adds a label
beside the component as well.
* In Flow, instead of `Button::setClickShortcut` that adds a shortcut key
to a button, a keypress event listener should be added. For example, the
following piece of code is equivalent to
`login.setClickShortcut(ShortcutAction.KeyCode.ENTER);`.

[source, java]
----
    loginForm.getElement()
        .addEventListener("keypress", event -> login())
        .setFilter("event.key == 'Enter'");
----

An improved keyboard shortcuts API will be available in Vaadin 13.

Some other changes that have been done are not related to Vaadin
framework migration process; however, it is a good idea to do such
refactorings at the same time as migration.

https://github.com/vaadin/bookstore-starter-flow/commit/8166683e91fc5fdc29ac8e9ce03d70c5e8731f56[Here] is
the link to see the changes in second migration step.

== Step 3 - Menu, MainScreen and AboutView

=== Menu

As explained before, instead of `CssLayout`, `FlexLayout` is used.

`Navigator` class is removed in Flow and this is one of many changes
in routing and navigation since version 8. So, `navigator`
field is removed from `Menu`. In `addView` method it can be seen that
navigation is done by `RouterLink` component.

At this stage a pretty look is not aimed and it will be made nicer in
later steps.

=== MainScreen

In Vaadin 8 version there is a `CssLayout` that acts as a view container
and navigation between different views is done inside the `CssLayout`. In
Vaadin Flow, parent layouts can be defined using a newly introduced
`RouterLayout` interface.  Since `MainScreen` is used as a layout for other
views, it must implement `RouterLayout` interface.

=== AboutView

Layout of views can be specified in `Route` annotation like this
`@Route(value = "About", layout = MainScreen.class)`. We don’t need the
`HelloWorldPage` anymore, so it is removed and since it’s good to have a
route to root path, `RouteAlias` annotation is used to add a secondary
path for `AboutView`.

Another thing worth mentioning here is that in Vaadin platform, a component
named `Icon` is added and can be created by calling `create` method of
`VaadinIcon` enum.

https://github.com/vaadin/bookstore-starter-flow/commit/f017602f668527d26f02f1cd2ef862f474ba033b[Here] is
the link to see the changes in step 3.

== Step 4 - Product Grid

=== DataProvider

In Vaadin platform, when `DataProvider::fetch` method is overridden,
`query.getOffset()` and `query.getLimit()` must be used to fetch a specific
chunk of data. If they are not used it shows that the returned data is
incorrect and unexpected. To avoid such mistakes in implemented code,
Vaadin platform throws an `IllegalStateException` to show us what is wrong. So,
`ProductDataProvider::fetch` is fixed in order to use specified offset
and limit. The data provider documentation for Vaadin platform can be found
https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/binding-data/tutorial-flow-data-provider.html[here].

=== ProductGrid

The following items briefly describe some of the changes in `ProductGrid`.

* There is no `HtmlRenderer` in Vaadin platform and it must be replaced by other
renderers such as `TemplateRenderer` or `ComponentRenderer`. In this
migration, `TemplateRenderer` is used. More info and guidance about all
kinds of renderers can be found in "Using Renderers" section of
https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/components/tutorial-flow-grid.html[Grid
document]. In `TemplateRenderer`, apart from HTML markup, Polymer data
binding notation can also be used. In `ProductGrid`, there are three
TemplateRenderers:

** Price and StockCount columns leverage `TemplateRenderer` to align their
text to right.
** Availability column template uses a Vaadin component named `iron-icon` to
show a circle colored based on availability value. In order to set different
styles to the circle, three css classes with equivalent names to three values
of availability (`Available`, `Coming` and `Discontinued`) are defined in a css
file (grid.css). Also, the dependency of the grid on the css file is defined by
adding `StyleSheet` annotation to `ProductGrid` class.

* `Grid.Column::setCaption` method is renamed to `setHeader`.
* `setFlexGrow` method is called for each column to set grow ratios of
them.

=== SampleCrudView

This is the page that includes `ProductGrid` and `ProductForm` and since
`ProductForm` is going to be migrated in next step, the parts of the code
related to it are commented. Like in the other views, a `Route` annotation
is added here with the "Inventory" value. Also, as this view is the main
view of the project, the route to root path, the `RouteAlias` annotation,
should be moved here. Other changes in `SampleCrudView` are the following
items.

* `getElement().getThemeList()::add` is used to add a theme variant to a
component. An improved API for this has been released in V12.
* In Vaadin 8, in order to get the parameters passed via the URL, `View`
interface must be implemented and the `enter` method must be overridden.
In Vaadin platform, there is an interface named `HasUrlParameter` that does the
job. It is generic, so parameters are safely converted to the given types.
More information about URL parameters can be found
https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/routing/tutorial-router-url-parameters.html[here].
* Instead of using `HorizontalLayout::setExpandRatio`,
`HorizontalLayout::expand` method is used.

https://github.com/vaadin/bookstore-starter-flow/commit/d628f29b81df8a94dacec72556a19f2d7f0ff019[Here]
is the link to see the changes in step four.

== Step 5 - Product Form

Since after this step, all Java code is migrated to Vaadin platform, it is time to
remove Vaadin 8 dependencies. Besides, keeping both versions may cause some
conflicts in their dependencies e.g. `jsoup`. So, `vaadin-server` and
`vaadin-push` are removed from pom.xml. Other changes in this step are as
follows.

=== ProductForm Design

The following items are some of the changes from Vaadin 8 to Vaadin platform
in design files.

* In Vaadin 8, Vaadin Designer uses HTML markups to store designed views
and they are stored in files with html extension. However, the tags that
are used by Vaadin Designer are not standard HTML tags. So, these html
files cannot be correctly shown and rendered by browsers. While in Vaadin platform,
Polymer template is used to define views and
Vaadin Designer also uses it to store designed views.
* Prefix of the Vaadin components names is changed from `v` to `vaadin`.
* For customizing the look and feel of the components using the provided
theme variants, the variants are applied with the `theme` attribute,
instead of the `style-name` (class name). E.g.

Vaadin 8 version:
[source, html]
----
<v-button style-name="primary" _id="save">Save</v-button>
----

Vaadin platform version:

[source, html]
----
<vaadin-button theme="primary" id="save">Save</vaadin-button>
----

=== ProductForm Java Class

`ProductFormDesign` class is removed and its content is moved to
`ProductForm` class. Actually, this is the recommended pattern in Vaadin platform
and it is also supported by Vaadin Designer. In Vaadin 8, Vaadin
Designer keeps two classes, a superclass for designer generated code and
an inherited class for the code implemented by developer. The following
items are some of the changes in `ProductForm`.

* `HtmlImport` and Tag annotations are the required annotations to connect
`ProductForm` class to its design file, ProductFormDesign.html. And unlike
Vaadin 8, reading the design file is done automatically and there is not
need to call `Design.read`.
* `Id` annotation is used to connect fields to their equivalents in the
associated polymer template.
* In `ComboBox`, `setEmptySelectionAllowed` method is renamed to
`setAllowCustomValue`.
* `CheckboxGroup` has been released in Vaadin 12.

The commit showing the changes for a migrated product form is

=== ErrorView

Router Exception Handling in Vaadin Flow is described
<<../routing/tutorial-routing-exception-handling#,here>>. Applications can have different views for catching different exceptions.
For example, `ErrorView` catches `NotFoundException` that is thrown when
something goes wrong while resolving navigation routes. And unlike
Vaadin 8, there is no need to register `ErrorView` in a `navigator` or
something like that. It is automatically detected and is used by Flow.

The commit showing the migration of the error view is
https://github.com/vaadin/bookstore-starter-flow/commit/c909f99c0a483ab4b6b5a83534be1c8de8a5d5b2#diff-c0d70f19c05c81ab072bb1d2e9c659e2[here].

=== SampleCrudLogic

Apart from some cleaning, a small change that is worth mentioning is the
change in how the URL of the browser is updated. In Vaadin 8,
`page.setUriFragment` is called and the new URL must be constructed and
passed as a parameter. While in Vaadin Flow, it is done in a more elegant
way; `navigate` method of `UI` class is called and the view parameter is
passed as a parameter to `navigate` method.

the link to see all changes in step five.

== Step 6 - Production Mode
The best practice to have the production mode in Vaadin Flow is adding a profile
to pom.xml. So, the production module is no longer needed and is removed and a
profile named productionMode is added to pom.xml of ui module. In terms of
production mode, there are some differences between Vaadin 8 and Flow. The new
production mode of Flow is fully described
https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/production/tutorial-production-mode-basic.html[Here].

== Step 7 - Theming the application
This step is still in progress and its documentation will be added here when it
is completed.
