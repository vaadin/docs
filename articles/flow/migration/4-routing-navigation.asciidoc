= Routing and Navigation

Routing and navigation are core concepts for any web application or site. In Vaadin Flow this has been completely reinvented.
In Vaadin 8 and 7 `Navigator` only supported single-level navigation, had limited support for parameters and did not support HTML5 History API until Vaadin 8.2.

`Router` is the new navigation API provided by Vaadin Flow. This document only outlines the core concept and how it differs from the old `Navigator`.
To get the best picture on the capabilities of the new `Router`, you should visit the <<../routing/tutorial-routing-annotation#,Router documentation>>.

The `Router` API allows building robust and complex application structures with hierarchies,
error handling and view access control by using lifecycle events.

The routes are configured declaratively on each navigation target and are the same for the entire application,
unlike in V8 where configuration was made for each UI instance separately:

[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "company", layout = MainLayout.class)
public class CompanyView extends Composite<Div> {
     // Implementation omitted
}
----

Thus, when migrating from using `Navigator`, any `View` from Vaadin 8 can be migrated to Vaadin Flow by removing the registration
from the now optional `UI` class and instead applying the `@Route` annotation the class.
*Note* that there is no `View` interface in Vaadin Flow, but instead the class must be a `Component`!

To receive an event when the user navigates to or from a view,
make it implement one of `BeforeEnterObserver`, `BeforeLeaveObserver` or `AfterNavigationObserver` interfaces
instead of the `enter` and `beforeLeave` methods from `View` in Vaadin 8.
`BeforeLeaveEvent.postpone()` can be used to postpone or cancel navigation to achieve the same results as selectively calling `ViewBeforeLeaveEvent.navigate()` in Vaadin 8.

Instead of manually constructing URLs and using `ViewChangeEvent.getParameters()` to find parameter values, you can use `UI.navigate(NavigationTargetClass.class)` and have your view implement the `HasUrlParameter` interface.

The `ViewDisplay` concept is replaced in Vaadin Flow with the `RouterLayout` interface, but now it is possible to have nested hierarchies,
by using the `@ParentLayout` annotation to set one `RouterLayout` class as the parent of another.

There is no `ViewProvider` in Vaadin Flow as it is not needed.

With the HTML5 History API, it is possible to have deep-linking and use proper navigation state and parameters for the navigation targets.
Flow supports optional parameters. It is not anymore possible to use the fragment style (`#!`) navigation state from V8
as the fragment is not intended to be used on the server side at all, but just be a browser feature for navigation inside a page.

It is very much recommended to take a look at the <<../routing/tutorial-routing-annotation#,router documentation>>
to get full understanding on how to structure your Vaadin Flow application.
