= Menu Configuration

To generate a custom menu, the [classname]`MenuConfiguration` may be used for collecting defined server and client routes. Client routes are taken from the FileSystem routes definition. Server routes come from routes annotated with [annotationname]`@Menu`.

The collected menu items are filtered by access control from the [classname]`UI` (i.e., [classname]`NavigationAccessControl` and [classname]`ViewAccessChecker`). If the application has login and route defined `Roles`, the returned list is filtered on only available routes.


== Creating Routes Menu

For a Flow application, any route annotated with [annotationname]`@Menu` is eligible for collection.

To get the available menu routes, call the static method `MenuConfiguration.getMenuEntries()`. This returns a [classname]`List<MenuEntry>`, first sorted in order found, then by path alphabetically and locale. It makes creating a simple menu by using [classname]`Anchor`, which can look like this:

[source,java]
----
List<MenuEntry> menuEntries = MenuConfiguration.getMenuEntries();
menuEntries.forEach(entry -> layout.add(new Anchor(entry.path(), entry.title())));
----


== Data Returned for Menu Entries

The [classname]`MenuEntry` for a route contains information on the route. Using this data, it's possible to populate a menu, automatically.

The data contained is as follows:

`path`::
Route path that should be used for navigation.

`title`::
Title set in the [annotationname]`@Menu` annotation or the [annotationname]`@PageTitle`, if defined -- otherwise, the class simple name. For the client, title is populated from the FS router data.

`order`::
Order number for the menu entry, if defined.

`icon`::
Icon to use in the menu. This value can be entered inside a `<vaadin-icon>` element's `icon` attribute. It accepts icon group and a name like `vaadin:file`. Or the value can be given in `<vaadin-icon>` element's `src` attribute, which takes the path to the icon (e.g., `line-awesome/svg/lock-open-solid.svg`).

`menuClass`::
Source class of the [annotationname]`@Menu` annotation. Always null for client routes.
