= Menu Registry

To generate a custom menu there's the [classname]`MenuRegistry` for collecting defined server and client routes. Client routes are collected from the FileSystem routes definition. Server routes are collected for routes annotated with [annotationname]`@Menu`.

The collected menu items are filtered by access control from the [classname]`UI` ([classname]`NavigationAccessControl` and [classname]`ViewAccessChecker`). If the application has login and route defined `Roles`, the returned list is filtered for only available routes.


== Creating Routes Menu

For a Flow application, any route annotated with [annotationname]`@Menu` is eligible for automatic collection.

To get the available menu routes, call the static method `MenuRegistry.collectMenuItems()`. This returns a [classname]`Map<String, AvailableViewInfo>`. The key in the returned map is the route path that should be used for navigation. It would make creating a simple menu using [classname]`Anchor` look like this:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, AvailableViewInfo> menuItems = MenuRegistry.collectMenuItems();
menuItems.forEach((path, info) -> layout.add(new Anchor(path, info.menu().title())));
----


=== Only Server Routes for Hybrids

For a hybrid application in which only server menu items are wanted, there's the static method [methodname]`collectAndAddServerMenuItems`. It takes in the [classname]`RouteConfiguration` to use, and a [classname]`Map` into which to populate the routes.

This could be called as follows:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, AvailableViewInfo> menuRoutes = new HashMap<>();
MenuRegistry.collectAndAddServerMenuItems(RouteConfiguration.forApplicationScope(), menuRoutes);
----


== Creating Client Routes Menu on Server

For client routes, the same static method `MenuRegistry.collectMenuItems()` can also be used to get server routes.


=== Only Client Routes for Hybrids

To collect only the client routes, [classname]`MenuRegistry` has the method [methodname]`getClientRoutes(boolean filterClientViews, AbstractConfiguration configuration)`. The `boolean filterClientViews` is used to define whether the accessible client routes should be removed from the result. The required configuration can be gotten from the [classname]`VaadinService` method, [methodname]`getDeploymentConfiguration()`.

For a full list, there's also the shorthand method [methodname]`getClientRoutes()` in [classname]`FrontendUtils`. For creating a client menu, see <</hilla/guides/routing#creating-menu-from-routes,Creating Menu From Routes>>.


== Data Returned for Menu Items

The [classname]`AvailableViewInfo` for the route contains information on the route. Using this data, it's possible to populate a menu, automatically.

The data contained is as follows:

`title`::
The [annotationname]`@PageTitle` if defined; else the class simple name. For the client, title is populated from the FS router data.

`rolesAllowed`::
Array of roles that are allowed for the item.

`loginRequired`::
Whether menu route requires a login to be viewed.

`route`::
Route for the view.
On the server this should match the array key. For client routes, though, this may be missing parent path parts, if any.

`lazy`::
Not in use. Later marks the route as lazy loaded from a different bundle.

`register`::
Whether route should be registered automatically into a menu.

`menu`::
[classname]`MenuData` on the [annotationname]`@Menu`. See below for menu definitions.

`children`::
Hierarchy information on routes below the given view. For client routes only.

`routeParameters`::
Defines any route parameters and their [classname]`RouteParamType`


Data in [classname]`MenuData`:

`title`::
Title set in the annotation or the same as [classname]`AvailableViewInfo.title`.

`order`::
Order number for the menu item if defined.

`exclude`::
Whether item should be excluded for the automatic menu.

`icon`::
Icon to use in the menu. The value can be entered inside a `<vaadin-icon>` element's `icon` attribute. This accepts icon group and a name like `vaadin:file`. Or the value can be given in `<vaadin-icon>` element's `src` attribute, which takes the path to the icon (e.g., `line-awesome/svg/lock-open-solid.svg`).
