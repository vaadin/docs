[[osgi.karaf]]
= Using Vaadin With Karaf

The Karaf `http` feature along with `war` feature provides HTTP Whiteboard implementation 
which is de facto standard in Karaf.
This implementation is known as PAX Web (see HTTP feature details https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest-2.x/users-guide/http.html[here]).
PAX Web is not fully compliant to HTTP Whiteboard OSGi Compendium 7 specification: there are some issues related to
`ServletContextListener` support. 
Due to these issues the recommended `VaadinServlet` registration way described in
generic <<osgi-basic#,Using Vaadin with OSGi>> tutorial doesn't work in PAX Web.

It's still possible to use Vaadin OSGi support with PAX Web though. 
But the `OSGiVaadinServlet` should be used
as a base class for the servlet which is registered in an OSGi bundle:

[source, Java]
----
@org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component(service = Servlet.class)
@HttpWhiteboardServletAsyncSupported
@HttpWhiteboardServletPattern("/*")
public class FixedVaadinServlet extends OSGiVaadinServlet {

    @Override
    protected void servletInitialized() throws ServletException {
        getService().setClassLoader(getClass().getClassLoader());
    }

}
----

Refer to generic <<osgi-basic#,Using Vaadin with OSGi>> tutorial for other non-Karaf related details.


[[karf.base.starter]]
== Karaf Base Starter

A Karaf base starter project is available at https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-flow-karaf.

The project may be used as a basis for a custom OSGi Vaadin web bundle project.
The README contains information how to run Karaf, install all required Karaf features and install project feature to the 
existing Karaf container.

The base project generated `feature` Maven artifact classifier which contains all the dependencies for the 
project and it can be used as a basis for custom project "feature".
A few Karaf features already provided by Vaadin (see below).


[[karf.features]]
== Karaf Features

One of the most important question which needs to be solved when OSGi bundle is deployed to the OSGi container is 
the bundle dependencies resolution. 
The bundle does not work in the OSGi container even though it's deployed
until all its dependencies are resolved.
Karaf allows to solve this via `"feature"` concept: bundles can be combined into a `"feature"` 
which contains all dependency bundles and it can be installed as one unit.

Vaadin provides several features which can be used depending on requirements:
- flow-server
- flow-data
- flow-osgi
- flow
- vaadin-core
- vaadin

The `flow-server` feature contains the minimum dependencies which have to be added to any Vaadin web project.
The `flow-osgi` feature contains necessary dependency for Vaadin OSGi web bundle.
The `flow` feature combines all Flow bundles altogether and it's convenient when you use all 
Flow modules in your project but it may be too big for your purposes (some bundles can be excluded from it).
The similar situation is with `vaadin-core`  and `vaadin` features: they combine all Flow bundles
(including `flow`  feature) plus all Vaadin components (the first one contains all free components,
the second one includes free and commercial components). These features can be used 
as is if you want to deploy everything to the Karaf container and don't think about 
anything else. But it's also possible to use the features as a base for a custom feature.

The feature can be installed into the Karaf container via two command:

[source]
----
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:com.vaadin/flow/$FLOW_VERSION$/xml/features
karaf@root()> feature:install flow
----

Here is `$FLOW_VERSION$` is a placeholder for the Flow artifact version value.
The first command uses `feature` Maven classifier to add feature repository (which is an XML file with feature declaration).
The second command installs the feature which is declared in the added repository.
http://tools.vaadin.com/nexus/content/repositories/vaadin-prereleases/com/vaadin/flow/6.0.0.beta1/flow-6.0.0.beta1-features.xml[Here] is an example
of the feature repository.

The same can be done with any mentioned feature.

Sometimes it might be useful to install a bundle without a feature. This can be done
this way:

[source]
----
karaf@root()> bundle:install mvn:com.vaadin/flow-html-components/$FLOW_VERSION$
karaf@root()> bundle:install mvn:com.vaadin/vaadin-text-field-flow/$TEXT_FIELD_VERSION$
----

The command refers to the Maven artifact via `com.vaadin`  group id, `flow-html-components` (`vaadin-text-field-flow`) artifact id and
the artifact version.
