= Server-Side Modality

A dialog with a client-side modality curtain alone does not disable the UI to which it belongs to on the server side.
If the dialog or its modality curtain is removed from the DOM on the client side, its parent UI remains active on the server and can be interacted with.

To fully prevent interactions with components that are underneath a modal dialog (or any modal component, for that matter) Flow has a feature called server-side modality.
This feature makes Flow ignore interactions with all components that are not children of the modal component while it is attached or marked as modal.
The components that are not children of the modal component are said to be _inert_, that is, they are not available for interaction.

As the server-side modality feature is purely a server-side security feature that only prevents interaction, it does not add a modality curtain or change the visible state of the components in the UI. 
Adding a modality curtain should be handled by the component.

Router Links, and navigation in general, are an exception.
Navigation is also allowed when inert, as there is no way to block navigation entirely on the server side.
Also JavaScript return values are accepted for server initiated executions.

The [classname]`UI` class provides methods that allow working with the server-side modality feature. 
The following Vaadin components make use of the feature: Dialog, Notification and Login View.

Modal dialogs can be stacked on top of each other, but only the most recent will be active.
A modal dialog can open another modal dialog, or several modeless dialogs, which again can open modal or modeless dialogs.

[NOTE]
Opening a new Dialog, Confirm Dialog, or Notification when a modal Dialog is already open automatically makes the new Dialog or Notification a child of the previously opened Dialog.
Closing the "parent" Dialog also closes all subsequently opened Dialogs and Notifications.

The implementation relies on a server-side-only state tree feature called [classname]`InertData`, which makes it possible to stop a component/element/state node and its children from accepting any updates from client side. 
By default, the inert state is inherited to child nodes.
However, any child can declare itself to ignore parent inert state, which means that updates are allowed for itself and its children, unless these are explicitly made inert.

This documentation is focused on the usage of the following methods of [classname]`UI` instance:

* [methodname]`addModal(Component)`
* [methodname]`setChildComponentModal(Component, boolean)`
* [methodname]`hasModalComponent()`
* [methodname]`addToModalComponent(Component)`

== Using Modal Components

Use the [methodname]`UI.addModal(Component)` method to add a modal component to the UI or make an attached component modal with [methodname]`UI.setChildComponentModal(Component, true)`.

This makes all components not children to the modal component in the UI inert.

[NOTE]
If there is a modal component and you add a new one with `addModal(Component)` the new component will be the active component.
Removing the modality/component will return the last modal component to active status keeping modality.

When the component is later removed from the UI or defined as non modal with `setChildComponentModal(Component, false)`, the UI will no longer be inert (unless there was another modal component underneath the removed component).

.Adding a modal component
[source,java]
----
// Add a modal component, and make the rest of the UI inert
UI.getCurrent().addModal(component);

/* other code*/

// Remove the modal component. The UI will no longer be inert.
UI.getCurrent().remove(component);
----

To make an already added component modal, use [methodname]`UI.setChildComponentModal(Component, boolean)`.

.Making a component modal
[source,java]
----
// Make a component modal, and make the rest of the UI inert
UI.getCurrent().setChildComponentModal(component, true);

/* other code*/

// Make the component non modal. The UI will no longer be inert.
UI.getCurrent().setChildComponentModal(component, false);

== Adding to Modal Component

Adding a component to the currently active modal component use `UI.addToModalComponent(Component)` which will add the component under the current modal component.

This is meant to be used with components that are not added as part of a  layout, like dialog, so that they are interactive when a modal component opens up an overlay component.

To check if there is a defined modal component use `UI.hasModalComponent`.
This is usually needed if a new component is added, and for it to be usable it needs to be added under the modal
component.

[NOTE]
When there is no active modal component, using `addToModalComponent(Component)` will add the component to the UI.

== Demo

An example project can be found https://github.com/taefi/server-modality-demo[here] which
demonstrates the above APIs in action. This demo application contains the following views to present some possibilities
with server-modality:

* **Dialog Modality Show-case**: Basic usage and comparison between Modeless vs. Client Modal vs. Server Modal for
dialogs.
* **Grid With Large Dataset**: Shows a server-modal dialog on the view while a long-running process is in progress.
* **Modality on Top of Dialog**: Shows how to use `UI#addToModalComponent` to add a modal component to the *current*
modal component.
