[[push.configuration]]
= Server Push Configuration

[.lead]
Server push allows you to update the UI from the server, without the user explicitly requesting for updates (via a button click or other interaction).

For example, server push can be used to send a new chat message for all participants without delay.

It is based on a client-server connection which the client establishes and the server can then use to send updates to the client.

The server-client communication uses a WebSocket connection, if the browser and the server support it.
If not, the connection falls back to a method supported by the browser.
Vaadin uses the link:https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere[Atmosphere framework] internally.

[[push.configuration.enabling]]
== Enabling Push in Your Application

To enable server push, you need to define the push mode either in the deployment
descriptor or with the `@Push` annotation on your application shell class.

[[push.configuration.pushmode]]
=== Push Modes and Transports

You can use server push in two modes: `automatic` and `manual`.
The automatic mode pushes changes to the browser automatically after `access()` finishes.
With the manual mode, you can do the push explicitly with `push()`, which allows more flexibility.

Server push can use several transports: WebSockets, long polling, or combined WebSockets+XHR.
WebSockets+XHR is the default transport.

[[push.configuration.annotation]]
=== The Push Annotation

You can enable server push for the application with the `@Push` annotation as follows. It defaults to automatic mode (`PushMode.AUTOMATIC`).

[source,java]
----
@Push
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
  ...
}
----

To enable manual mode, you need to give the `PushMode.MANUAL` parameter as follows:


[source,java]
----
@Push(PushMode.MANUAL)
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
  ...
}
----

To use the long polling transport, you need to set the transport parameter as `Transport.LONG_POLLING` as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Push(transport = Transport.LONG_POLLING)
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
  ...
}
----

[[push.configuration.servlet]]
=== Servlet Configuration

If you are configuring your servlet manually, make sure to set the `async-supported` parameter.

You can enable server push and define the push mode for an entire application in the servlet
configuration with the `pushmode` parameter for the servlet in the
`web.xml` deployment descriptor or a corresponding `@WebServlet` annotation.

It is also possible to configure the URL to use for push requests by setting the `pushURL` parameter.
This is useful for servers that require a predefined URL to push.



[[push.access]]
== Asynchronous Updates

Making changes to a UI from another thread and pushing them to the browser requires locking the user session.
Otherwise, the UI update done from another thread could conflict with a regular event-driven update and cause either data corruption or deadlocks.
Because of this, you may only access an UI using the `access()` method, which locks the session to prevent conflicts.
It takes as parameter a `Command` to execute while the session is locked.

For example:

[source,java]
----
ui.access(new Command() {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        statusLabel.setText(statusText);
    }
});
----

You also use a lambda expression to define your access command.

[source,java]
----
ui.access(() -> statusLabel.setText(statusText));
----

If the push mode is `manual`, you need to push the pending UI changes to the browser explicitly with the `push()` method.

[source,java]
----
ui.access(() -> {
    statusLabel.setText(statusText);
    ui.push();
});
----

Below is a complete example of a case where we make UI changes from another thread.

[source,java]
----

@Push
@Route("push")
public class PushyView extends VerticalLayout {
    private FeederThread thread;

    @Override
    protected void onAttach(AttachEvent attachEvent) {
        add(new Span("Waiting for updates"));

        // Start the data feed thread
        thread = new FeederThread(attachEvent.getUI(), this);
        thread.start();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDetach(DetachEvent detachEvent) {
        // Cleanup
        thread.interrupt();
        thread = null;
    }

    private static class FeederThread extends Thread {
        private final UI ui;
        private final PushyView view;

        private int count = 0;

        public FeederThread(UI ui, PushyView view) {
            this.ui = ui;
            this.view = view;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                // Update the data for a while
                while (count < 10) {
                    // Sleep to emulate background work
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                    String message = "This is update " + count++;

                    ui.access(() -> view.add(new Span(message)));
                }

                // Inform that we are done
                ui.access(() -> {
                    view.add(new Span("Done updating"));
                });
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

When sharing data between UIs or user sessions, you need to consider the message-passing mechanism more carefully, as explained in the next section.


[[push.broadcaster]]
== Collaborative Views

Broadcasting messages to be pushed to UIs in other user sessions requires some sort of message-passing mechanism that sends the messages to all UIs that are registered as recipients.
As processing server requests for different UIs happens concurrently in different threads of the application server, locking the data structures is important to avoid deadlock situations.

[[push.broadcaster.broadcaster]]
=== The Broadcaster

The standard pattern for sending messages to other users is to use a _broadcaster_ singleton that registers recipients and broadcasts messages to them.
To avoid deadlocks, it is recommended that the messages are sent through a message queue in a separate thread.
Using a Java `ExecutorService` running a single thread is one of the easiest and safest ways.
The methods in the class are defined as `synchronized` to prevent race conditions.


[source,java]
----
public class Broadcaster {
    static Executor executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

    static LinkedList<Consumer<String>> listeners = new LinkedList<>();

    public static synchronized Registration register(
            Consumer<String> listener) {
        listeners.add(listener);

        return () -> {
            synchronized (Broadcaster.class) {
                listeners.remove(listener);
            }
        };
    }

    public static synchronized void broadcast(String message) {
        for (Consumer<String> listener : listeners) {
            executor.execute(() -> listener.accept(message));
        }
    }
}
----


[[push.broadcaster.receiving]]
=== Receiving Broadcasts

The receivers need register a consumer to the broadcaster to receive the broadcasts.
The registration should be removed when the component is no longer attached.
When updating the UI in a receiver, it should be done safely by executing the update through the `access()` method of the UI, as described in the previous section, <<push.access>>.

[source,java]
----
@Push
@Route("broadcaster")
public class BroadcasterView extends Div {
    VerticalLayout messages = new VerticalLayout();
    Registration broadcasterRegistration;

    // Creating the UI shown separately

    @Override
    protected void onAttach(AttachEvent attachEvent) {
        UI ui = attachEvent.getUI();
        broadcasterRegistration = Broadcaster.register(newMessage -> {
            ui.access(() -> messages.add(new Span(newMessage)));
        });
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDetach(DetachEvent detachEvent) {
        broadcasterRegistration.remove();
        broadcasterRegistration = null;
    }
}
----


[[push.broadcaster.sending]]
=== Sending Broadcasts

To send broadcasts with a broadcaster singleton, such as the one described above, you would only need to call the `broadcast()` method as follows.

[source,java]
----
public BroadcasterView() {
    TextField message = new TextField();
    Button send = new Button("Send", e -> {
        Broadcaster.broadcast(message.getValue());
        message.setValue("");
    });

    HorizontalLayout sendBar = new HorizontalLayout(message, send);

    add(sendBar, messages);
}
----
