= Making a component add-on OSGi-compatible

In order to use a component jar as an OSGi bundle, the manifest file needs to
have additional headers. The headers describe the bundle and provide additional
information. Some of the headers are as follows.

- *Bundle-SymbolicName* is the only mandatory header. It specifies a unique
  identifier for the bundle, based on the reverse domain name convention. e.g.
  `com.vaadin.flow.component.button`
- *Bundle-Name* defines a human-readable name. e.g. vaadin-button-flow
- *Bundle-License* specifies the license information of bundle. e.g.
  \http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
- *Bundle-ManifestVersion* indicates the OSGi specification to use for reading
  this bundle. The value 1 indicates OSGi release 3, and the value 2 indicates
  OSGi release 4 and later.
- *Bundle-Version* specifies the version of this bundle which consists of up to
  four parts separated with dots.
- *Import-Package* declares the imported packages for this bundle.
- *Export-Package* contains a declaration of exported packages.
- *Require-Capability* specifies that this bundle requires other bundles to
  provide a capability e.g. osgi.ee;filter:="(&(osgi.ee=JavaSE)(version=1.8))"

After generating the MANIFEST.MF file, manually or using any tool, it should be
added to the output jar file. This job can be done by configuring
`maven-jar-plugin` like this:

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <archive>
            <manifestFile>${project.build.outputDirectory}/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</manifestFile>
        </archive>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

[NOTE]
Static resources do not work in OSGi environment for now and it is
required to unpack them in the application project.

== Tools

Although the headers can be added to MANIFEST.MF manually, it is recommended to
use an automated tool to create them. Here two tools, both maven plugins, are
briefly introduced.

=== Bnd maven plugin

This plugin generates required manifest entries based on specified instructions
which are declared in either a file (with default name of bnd.bnd) or the
plugin `<configuration>` in the pom. The plugin also set default values to some
headers derived from pom elements. For example, `Bundle-SymbolicName` is set to
`artifactId`, and `Bundle-Version` is deducted from artifact version. The
following is an example of the usage of the plugin.

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>biz.aQute.bnd</groupId>
    <artifactId>bnd-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>bnd-process</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <bnd><![CDATA[
             -exportcontents: org.example.api,org.example.types
             -sources: true
             Private-Package: org.example.internal.*
             Bundle-Activator: org.foo.myproject.impl.Activator
             ]]>
        </bnd>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

In this example, the instructions are provided using `<![CDATA[ ]]>` section in
`bnd` parameter. In addition to the instructions, that start with a minus sign
('-'), manifest headers (e.g. `Private-Package`) can also be added here.  For
more information about instructions see
https://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/820-instructions.html[Bnd Instruction
Reference].

For more information about this plugin see
https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/tree/master/maven/bnd-maven-plugin[bnd-maven-plugin
documentation on GitHub].

=== Apache Felix Maven Bundle Plugin

This plugin is based on Bnd tool with this change that you can provide headers
and instructions as nested tags in `<configuration>` section. So, it may be a
better choice when we want to have instructions in the `pom` file.
Although the values of the required entries in the manifest file can be set
manually, this plugin generates reasonable default values for various headers.
Here is an example on how to use the plugin.

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.felix</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-bundle-plugin</artifactId>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>bundle-manifest</id>
            <phase>process-classes</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>manifest</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <instructions>
            <_exportcontents>org.example.api,org.example.types</_exportcontents>
            <_sources>true</_sources>
            <Private-Package>org.example.internal.*</Private-Package>
            <Bundle-Activator>org.foo.myproject.impl.Activator</Bundle-Activator>
        </instructions>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

With these instructions, the plugin generates for instance `Bundle-Version`
deducted from `${pom.version}`, `Bundle-Name` set to `${pom.name}` and
`Bundle-SymbolicName` computed from `groupId` and `artifactId`. For more
information see
http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html[Apache
Felix Maven Bundle Plugin documentation].
