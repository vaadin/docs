= Using StreamReceiver to Receive an Incoming Data Stream

To receive an upload from the client, we need to register a [classname]`StreamReceiver` that accepts a URL to handle receiving an upload stream.

To create a [classname]`StreamReceiver`, we first need to create a [classname]`StreamVariable` that monitors and controls terminal upload during the time it is being streamed.

Then the stream can be registered through the [classname]`Element` API.

[source,java]
----
StreamReceiver streamReceiver = new StreamReceiver(
    getElement().getNode(), "upload", getStreamVariable());
getElement().setAttribute("target", streamReceiver);
