= Using StreamReceiver to Receive an Incoming Data Stream

To receive an upload from the client, we need to register a [classname]#StreamReceiver# that accepts a URL to handle receiving an upload stream.

To create a [classname]#StreamReceiver#, we first need to create a [classname]#StreamVariable# that monitors and controls terminal upload during the time it is being streamed.

Then the stream can be registered through the [classname]#Element# API.

[source,java]

StreamReceiver streamReceiver = new StreamReceiver(
    getElement().getNode(), "upload", getStreamVariable());
getElement().setAttribute("target", streamReceiver);
