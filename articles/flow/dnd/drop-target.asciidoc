= Creating a Drop Target

With the `DropTarget` class you can make any component a drop target that the user can
drop things on. When the drop occurs, you can get an event on the server side and
get the data related to the drag operation when the drag has originated from the
same UI (browser window/tab). The `DropTarget` class is a configuration object
for the drop target and contains static methods for configuring the given component
as a drop target instance.

[source, java]
----
VerticalLayout first = new VerticalLayout();
VerticalLayout second = new VerticalLayout();

// makes first layout an active drop target
DropTarget<VerticalLayout> dropTarget = DropTarget.create(first);

// provides access to drop target API for second layout,
// without setting it as an active drop target
DropTarget<VerticalLayout> dropTarget2 = DropTarget.configure(second);
// change previously set settings
dropTarget2.setDropEffect(DropEffect.NONE);
----

The `DropTarget` configuration object doesn't itself store any data, as it is
just an API extension that allows easily making any component a drop target.
Creating a new `DropTarget` instance of a component will not reset any previous
configuration, but any changes will override previous configuration.

Similarly as with the `DragSource`, the `DropTarget` is a "mixin interface"
which can be added to any custom component to expose the drop target API for it.

[source, java]
----
public class Column extends VerticalLayout implements DropTarget<VerticalLayout> {

    public Column() {
        // allow drops by default
        setActive(true);
    }
    // all drop target methods have default implementations
}
----

== Reacting To Drops

When the user performs a valid drop on the browser, the `DropEvent` is fired.
You can listen to the event with a `DropListener`. In case the drag originated
from within the same Vaadin UI, you can get the retrieve the dragged component
or the assigned business data from the `DropEvent`.

[source, java]
----
Div box = new Div();
box.setWidth("300px");
box.setHeight("300px");

DropTarget<Div> dropTarget = DropTarget.create(box);

dropTarget.addDropListener(event -> {
    // move the dragged component to inside the drop target component
    if (event.getDropEffect() == DropEffect.MOVE) {
        // the drag source is available only if the dragged component is from
        // the same UI as the drop target
        event.getDragSourceComponent().ifPresent(box::add);

        event.getDragData().ifPresent(data -> {
            // the server side drag data is available if it has been set and the
            // component was dragged from the same UI as the drop target
        });
    }
});
----

You can read more about setting the server side drag data from the previous
chapter about <<drag-source#drag.data,`DragSource`>>. At the moment (in version 14.1)
there is no way to retrieve any client side drag data from the drop event.

== Controlling the Drop with Drop Effect

The `DropEffect` set to the drop target needs to match the `effectAllowed` set
for the drag operation in order for the drop to succeed. The drop effect is
determined in priority order by:

* The desired action `dropEffect` set by the drop target
* The `effectAllowed` set to the drag source
* The modifier keys the user had pressed and hold when dropping

This means that not setting a drop effect for a drop target will allow either
the drag source or the user to determine the drop effect. The possible values
for the drop effect are: `COPY`, `MOVE`, `LINK` and `NONE`. Setting the drop
effect to `NONE` means that the drop cannot occur, and thus no `DropEvent` will
be fired.

[NOTE]
If the drop effect set to the drop target doesn't match the effectAllowed of the drag source, it
*does not* prevent drop on IE11, Edge and Safari! For FireFox and Chrome the drop is
prevented when the properties won't match. IE11, Edge and Safari allow the drop
but on `DragEnd` event do not prevent the drop.

== Drop Target Styling

When there is a valid drag over the drop target, the drop target element will
get the `v-drag-over-target` class name automatically while the dragged object
stays on top of the drop target. The class name is removed once either the drop
occurs, is canceled or the object is moved outside the drop target.

[source, css]
----
.v-drag-over-target.card {
    outline: 1px solid lightgreen;
}
----

Depending on the desired user experience, it might be good to highlight the possible
drop targets for a started drag during the `DragStart` event. See and example
of that in the <<drag-source, `DragSource`>> documentation.
