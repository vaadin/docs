== Design System Publisher

You may have some issues with Design System Publisher. Here are some common ones and suggestions on how to troubleshoot them.

// tag::dsp[]

Bug reports and feature requests can be submitted at the https://github.com/vaadin/design-system-publisher/issues[Design System Publisher GitHub repository].

[[dsp-cache]]
.+++<h3>Browser Doesn't Match Filesystem Content</h3>+++
[%collapsible]
====
To speed up the start process, the Design System Publisher caches some resources, internally. Sometimes, caches tend to get out of sync and need cleaning. Run the following command to flush the internal caches and restart the development server to see if it fixes the issue:

[source,terminal]
----
npm run dspublisher:clean
----

The issue may also concern the browser's cache. In case the above doesn't help, try cleaning the browser's cache, as well.

[[dsp-page-heading]]
.+++<h3>Page Heading Changes Not Rendered</h3>+++
[%collapsible]
====

There's one caveat about the page headings. On a regular page, if you change the main heading in the AsciiDoc (i.e., `= Page Heading`), you'll see the heading update as expected. But if you use `layout: tabbed-page` in the page front matter, the tabbed page heading is actually retrieved from the front matter's title field. Therefore, you may want to change that instead.

[[dsp-linux-dependencies]]
.+++<h3>Application Won't Start on Linux</h3>+++
[%collapsible]
====

When the application won't start on Linux, make sure that the necessary dependencies are installed by running the following at the command-line:

[source,terminal]
----
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config libpng-dev nasm zlib1g-dev
----
====

[[dsp-startup-failure]]
.+++<h3>Development Server Fails to Start</h3>+++
[%collapsible]
====

The `npm run dspublisher:start` script, which starts up the development server, has certain expectations about your development environment. The development server may fail to start for one of the following reasons:

[discrete]
==== npm Ignoring Scripts

If you configure `npm` with `ignore-scripts=true`, the startup fails. An example error message for this is the following:

----
Error in "/Users/[username]/.npm/_npx/c089b35bd0e8ac07/node_modules/@vaadin/dspublish
er/node_modules/gatsby-transformer-sharp/gatsby-node.js":
Something went wrong installing the "sharp" module

Cannot find module '../build/Release/sharp-darwin-arm64v8.node'
----

Remove the `ignore-scripts` configuration and delete the `/.npm/_npx` from the home directory to fix the issue.

[discrete]
==== Missing Xcode Command Line Tools

On macOS, you need https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/[install the `Xcode` Command Line Tools]. Otherwise you might receive the following type of error during start up:

----
dsp@[version]:start ████████████████████ Initializing
npx,concurrently,--kill-others,--raw,"npx @vaadin/dspublisher@[version] --develop","mvn -C" failed with code 1
----

==== Gatsby on Windows

Design System Publisher is based on Gatsby, which has known issues on Windows. If you're using Windows, see https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/gatsby-on-windows/[Gatsby on Windows] for more information.

It's recommended to use Linux or macOS as your development platform. On Windows, you can use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)] to run Design System Publisher.
