= Remote Procedure Calls

Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) are a way to execute procedures or subroutines in a different address space, typically on another machine.

Vaadin Flow handles server-client communication by allowing RPC calls from the server to the client, and _vice versa_.

== Calling Client-side Methods from the Server

You can execute client-side methods from the server by accessing the `Element` API.

=== callJsFunction Method

The `callJsFunction` method allows you to execute a client-side component function from the server side.
The method accepts two parameters: the name of the function to call, and the arguments to pass to the function.

The arguments passed to the function must be of a type supported by the communication mechanism. The supported types are `String`, `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Double`, `JsonValue`, `Element`, and `Component`.

*Example*: Using the `callJsFunction` method to execute the `clearSelection` function.

[source, java]
----
public void clearSelection() {
    getElement().callJsFunction("clearSelection");
}

public void setExpanded(Component component) {
    getElement().callJsFunction("expand",
            component.getElement());
}
----

=== executeJs Method

You can also use the `executeJs` method to execute JavaScript asynchronously from the server side.
You can use this method in addition to the `callJsFunction` method.

The `executeJs` method accepts two parameters: the JavaScript expression to invoke, and the parameters to pass to the expression.
Note that the given parameters are available as variables named `$0`, `$1`, and so on.

The arguments passed to the expression must be of a type supported by the communication mechanism. The supported types are `String`, `Integer`, `Double`, `Boolean` and `Element`.

*Example*: Using the `executeJs` method.

[source, java]
----
public void complete() {
    getElement().executeJs("this.complete($0)", true);
}
----

It is also possible to call the `executeJs` method to access methods and fields of a Web Component.

=== Return values

The return value from the JavaScript function called using `callJsFunction` or the value from a `return` statement in an `executeJs` expression can be accessed by adding a listener to the `PendingJavaScriptResult` instance returned from either method.

*Example*: Check if the browser supports Constructable Stylesheets.

[source, java]
----
public void checkConstructableStylesheets() {
    getElement().executeJs(
            "return 'adoptedStyleSheets' in document")
            .then(Boolean.class, supported -> {
                if (supported) {
                    System.out.println(
                            "Feature is supported");
                } else {
                    System.out.println(
                            "Feature is not supported");
                }
            });
}
----

[TIP]
If the return value is a JavaScript `Promise`, then a return value will be sent to the server only when the `Promise` is resolved.

== Calling Server-side Methods from the Client

=== @ClientCallable annotation

The `@ClientCallable` annotation allows you to invoke a server-side method from the client side.
It marks a method in a `Component` subclass that can be called from the client side using the `element.$server.serverMethodName(args)` notation.
In client-side Polymer template code, `this` refers to the corresponding element so that the calling convention is `this.$server.serverMethodName(args)`.

You can use it anywhere in your client-side Polymer class implementation, and can pass your own arguments in the method.
Note that the types should match the method declaration on the server side.
The supported argument types are:
- `boolean` , `int`, `double`, their boxed types (`Boolean` , `Integer`, `Double`)
- `String`
- `JsonValue`
- Enumeration type which is addressed via a string value from the client side JavaScript
- `TemplateModel` property types (see <<../templates/tutorial-model-bean#,Using Beans with a PolymerTemplate Model>>

The client-side method returns a Promise which will asynchronously be resolved with the return value from the server, or `null` if the server-side return type is `void`.
You can wait for the result using `Promise.then`.
In an `async` function, the `await` keyword can also be used for waiting for the result.

*Example*: Using `this.$server.getGreeting` to call a server-side method and `await` the result

[source, javascript]
----
async getServerGreeting() {
  let greeting = await this.$server.getGreeting("JavaScript");
  console.log(greeting);
}
----

*Example*: Using `this.$server.getGreeting` to call a server-side method and wait for the result in a callback.

[source, javascript]
----
getServerGreeting() {
  let greetingPromise = this.$server.getGreeting("JavaScript");
  greetingPromise.then(greeting => console.log(greeting));
}
----

*Example*: Using the `@ClientCallable` annotation on the server side.
[source, java]
----
@ClientCallable
public String getGreeting(String name) {
    return "Hello " + name;
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
Property changes, DOM events, client-delegate methods (methods annotated with `@ClientCallable`) and event-handler methods (`PolymerTemplate` methods annotated with `@EventHandler`) are blocked for disabled components.
