= Vaadin Forms: Data Binding and Validation

In the previous chapter, you started building a reusable form component. 
In this chapter, you define the form component API and use data binding to make the form functional.

== Binding Object Properties to Input Fields

A form is a collection of input fields that are connected to a data model, a `Contact` in this case. 
Forms validate user input and make it easy to get an object populated with input values from the UI. 

Vaadin users the <<../../binding-data/tutorial-flow-components-binder#,`Binder`>> class to build forms. 
It binds UI fields to data object fields by name. 
For instance, it takes a UI field named `firstName` and maps it to the `firstName` field of the data object, and the `lastName` field to the `lastName` field, and so on. 
This is why the field names in `Contact` and `ContactForm` are the same. 

.Advanced Binder API
[NOTE]
====
Binder also supports an <<../../binding-data/tutorial-flow-components-binder-validation#,advanced API>> where you can configure data conversions and additional validation rules, but for this application, the simple API is sufficient. 

Binder can use validation rules that are defined on the data object in the UI. 
This means you can run the same validations in both the browser and before saving to the database, without duplicating code. 
====

== Creating the Binder

The first step is to create a new binder field in the contact form. 

To do this, add the `BeanValidationBinder` field to `ContactForm` as follows:

.`ContactForm.java`
[source,java]
----
// Other fields omitted
Binder<Contact> binder = new BeanValidationBinder<>(Contact.class); // <1>

public ContactForm() {
    addClassName("contact-form");
    binder.bindInstanceFields(this); // <2>
    // Rest of constructor omitted
}
----
<1> `BeanValidationBinder` is a `Binder` that is aware of bean validation annotations. 
By passing it in the `Contact.class`, you define the type of object you are binding to.
<2> `bindInstanceFields` matches fields in `Contact` and `ContactForm` based on their names.

With these two lines of code, you've made the UI fields ready to be connected to a contact. 
That's the next step.

== Decoupling Components

In object-oriented programming you often want to decouple objects to increase their re-usability. 

In this app, you have a form component and use it in the `MainView`. 
The most straightforward approach would appear to be to let the form call methods on `MainView` directly to save a contact. 
But what happens if you need the same form in another view? 
Or if you want to write a test to verify that the form works as intended? 
In both cases, the dependency on `MainView` makes it more complex than is necessary. 
Coupling a component to a specific parent typically makes it more difficult to reuse and test. 

Instead, you should aim to make components that work in the same way as the Vaadin `Button` component: you can use them anywhere. 
You configure the component by setting properties, and the component notifies you of events through listeners. 

Creating a reusable component is as simple as making sure it can be configured through setters, and that it fires events whenever something happens. 
Using the component should not have side effects, for instance it shouldn't change anything in the database by itself.

== Defining the Form Component API

With the visual part of the component complete, the next step is to define the form component API. 
This is how developers interact with the form.

A good rule of thumb when designing an API for a reusable component is: *_properties in, events out_*. 
Users should be able to fully configure a component by setting properties.
They should be notified of all relevant events, without the need to manually call getters to see if things have changed. 

With this in mind, here's what the API consists of:

*Properties in:*

* Set the contact. 
* Set the list of companies.

*Events out:*

* Save.
* Delete.
* Close.

== Setting the Company and Contact Status

The two properties that need to be handled are the contact shown in the form and the list of companies shown in the dropdown. 

To set the company and contact status:

. In `ContactForm`, add the company list as a constructor parameter. 
Do this first, because the company list is needed before a contact can be edited.
+
.`ContactForm.java`
[source,java]
----
public ContactForm(List<Company> companies) { // <1>
  addClassName("contact-form");
  binder.bindInstanceFields(this);

  company.setItems(companies); // <2>
  company.setItemLabelGenerator(Company::getName); // <3>
  status.setItems(Contact.Status.values()); // <4>
 
   //omitted
}
----
<1> Adds a list of `Company` objects as a parameter to the constructor.
<2> Sets the list of `companies` as the items in the company combo box.
<3> Tells the combo box to use the name of the company as the display value.
<4> Populates the status dropdown with the values from the `Contact.Status` enum.
+
**You will get a compilation error if you build the application at this point.** This is because you have not yet passed a list of companies in `MainView`. 

. In `MainView`, update the constructor to take `CompanyService` as a parameter, and then use this service to pass a list of all companies.
+
.`MainView.java`
[source,java]
----
public MainView(ContactService contactService,
                CompanyService companyService) { // <1>
    this.contactService = contactService;
    addClassName("list-view");
    setSizeFull();

    configureGrid();
    configureFilter();

    form = new ContactForm(companyService.findAll()); // <2>

    add(filterText, grid, form);
    updateList();
}
----
<1> Auto wires (injects) `CompanyService` as a constructor parameter.
<2> Finds all companies and passes them to `ContactForm`.

== Updating the Contact

Next, you need to create a setter for the `contact` because it can change over time as a user browses through the contacts. 

To do this, add the following in the `ContactForm` class: 

.`ContactForm.java`
[source,java]
----
public class ContactForm extends FormLayout {
    private Contact contact;

    // other methods and fields omitted

    public void setContact(Contact contact) {
        this.contact = contact; // <1>
        binder.readBean(contact); // <2>
    }
}
----
<1> Save a reference to the contact so you can save the form values back into it later.
<2> Calls `binder.readBean` to bind the values from the contact to the UI fields. 
`readBean` copies the values from the Contact to an internal model, that way you don't overwrite values if you cancel editing.

== Setting Up Events

Vaadin comes with an event-handling system for components. 
You have already used it to listen to value-change events from the filter Text Field in the main view. 
The form component should have a similar way of informing parent components of events. 

To do this, add the following at the end of the `ContactForm` class:

.`ContactForm.java`
[source,java]
----
// Events
public static abstract class ContactFormEvent extends ComponentEvent<ContactForm> {
  private Contact contact;

  protected ContactFormEvent(ContactForm source, Contact contact) { // <1>
    super(source, false);
    this.contact = contact;
  }

  public Contact getContact() {
    return contact;
  }
}

public static class SaveEvent extends ContactFormEvent {
  SaveEvent(ContactForm source, Contact contact) {
    super(source, contact);
  }
}

public static class DeleteEvent extends ContactFormEvent {
  DeleteEvent(ContactForm source, Contact contact) {
    super(source, contact);
  }

}

public static class CloseEvent extends ContactFormEvent {
  CloseEvent(ContactForm source) {
    super(source, null);
  }
}

public <T extends ComponentEvent<?>> Registration addListener(Class<T> eventType,
    ComponentEventListener<T> listener) { // <2>
  return getEventBus().addListener(eventType, listener);
}
----
<1> `ContactFormEvent` is a common superclass for all the events. 
It contains the `contact` that was edited or deleted. 
<2> The `addListener` method uses Vaadin's event bus to register the custom event types. 
Select the `com.vaadin` import for `Registration` if IntelliJ asks.

== Saving, Deleting, and Closing the Form

With the event types defined, you can now inform anyone using `ContactForm` of relevant events.

To add `save`, `delete` and `close` event listeners, add the following to the `ContactForm` class:

.`ContactForm.java`
[source,java]
----
private Component createButtonsLayout() {
  // omitted

  save.addClickListener(event -> validateAndSave()); // <1> 
  delete.addClickListener(event -> fireEvent(new DeleteEvent(this, contact))); // <2>
  close.addClickListener(event -> fireEvent(new CloseEvent(this))); // <3>


  binder.addStatusChangeListener(e -> save.setEnabled(binder.isValid())); // <4>
  return new HorizontalLayout(save, delete, close);
}

private void validateAndSave() {
  try {
    binder.writeBean(contact); // <5>
    fireEvent(new SaveEvent(this, contact)); // <6>
  } catch (ValidationException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
}
----
<1> The save button calls the `validateAndSave` method
<2> The delete  button fires a delete event and passes the active contact.
<3> The cancel button fires a close event.
<4> Validates the form every time it changes. If it is invalid, it disables the save button to avoid invalid submissions.
<5> Write the form contents back to the original `contact`.
<6> Fire a save event so the parent component can handle the action.

In the next tutorial, you'll connect the form to the main view so that the selected contact in the form can be edited.
