:commercial-feature: TestBench

UI unit testing removes the need to run both the browser and the servlet container, to test more quickly your Vaadin-based applications.

TestBench UI unit testing is browser-less. Therefore, you would look up components straight from [methodname]`UI.getCurrent()`, bypassing the browser and the JavaScript -> server bridge. You'd call methods directly on your server-side view classes and on the server-side Java Vaadin components.

Because UI unit testing is also container-less, you don't need to launch the servlet container. The [classname]`UIUnitTest` class handles creating the Vaadin session, the UI and other necessary Vaadin classes right in the JVM that runs your JUnit tests.

In addition to UI unit testing, TestBench also allows you to write end-to-end tests for your Vaadin applications. <<../#comparison,Each approach has their own advantages>>.

[NOTE]
UI unit testing isn't supported in Java EE based projects due technical limitations in Weld JUnit 5 extension. Use instead End-to-End testing.
