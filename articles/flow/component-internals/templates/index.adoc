= Templates

In addition to imperative Java code, you can build views declaratively using templates. The components in such a template can be bound directly to data items.

In Vaadin, you have different options for how you build your views:

. Build your views purely with Java
. Define the layouts of your views declaratively and implement the UI logic in Java
. Build your views purely client-side with TypeScript and LitElement

These ways to build views can be mixed and matched within an application.
All Vaadin components are available through the Java API and declaratively in HTML.
The most appropriate option depends on your use case and preferences.
This chapter describes the second option: how to build your UIs declaratively, while implementing the logic in Java.

== Benefits of Using Templates

Defining the layout of a view separately from its logic results in clear, maintainable code.
It makes it easier to see how the view is defined and where it's updated.
HTML templates are a robust way of defining the UI structure, whereas Java is a great way to define the logic of the view.

Vaadin supports the declarative Lit template language.

Vaadin can refer to and access components defined by a template from Java.
When you give unique IDs to components in the template, you can access them through the Java API to configure the logic further.
You can add Java-only components such as compositions to a template by giving a layout an ID in the template and adding the components into the layout in Java code.

For example, `<vaadin-button id="my-button">Press me</vaadin-button>` can be accessed with `@Id("my-button") Button button;` in Java.

The framework parses the elements and their attributes inside a template to make the initial state of each mapped server-side component consistent with the attributes set in the template.

For instance, consider a template containing the text field `<vaadin-text-field id="name-field" placeholder="Enter name"></vaadin-text-field>`, which is mapped as the class member `@Id("name-field") TextField nameField` in Java.
After the server-side component is created, [methodname]`nameField.getPlaceholder()` returns the placeholder text (`"Enter name"`) immediately.


== Known Limitations of Templates

The template API has limitations that you need to be aware of before using it.
See <<limitations#, Template Limitations>> for details.

== Separating Structure and Logic

Try to only define things that don't change in the template, and leave all the dynamic parts to Java.
As an example, in the template, you can have attributes that never change, captions for components like `Button` and `TextField` that always stay the same, or styling for the view.
For instance, if the caption of a `Button` changes depending on user interaction, then leave it empty in the template and define the initial value in Java.

With `Grid`, defining columns may seem like a static part, but columns and data are strongly related.
When using `vaadin-grid` inside a `LitTemplate`, the column configuration and driving of data must happen from the server-side Java code.

See <<basic#,Creating a Component Using Templates>> for a full example with an HTML template and Java logic.
