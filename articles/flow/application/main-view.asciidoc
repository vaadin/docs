= Creating a Main View

_See the <<{articles}/fusion/application/main-view#, corresponding article>> for Fusion._

The [classname]#AppLayout# component allows creating typical main views that have a header, a menu, and a content area.
// TODO Actually still need to wire it by yourself
It fully works with routing and navigation, making it easier to set them up than wiring them by yourself.
It is responsive to changes in the screen size and orientation, and adapts both to desktop and mobile browsers.

[classname]#AppLayout# is highly flexible, allowing many kinds of main view layouts, either with horizontal or vertical menus, which can be displayed statically or open by clicking, and having many customizable elements.
See <<{articles}/ds/components/app-layout#, the Design System documentation>> for a showcase of the features.

The starter applications created with the https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start] by default use the [classname]#AppLayout# to create the main view.

[[flow.application.main-view.main-view]]
== The Main View

A main view uses the [classname]#AppLayout# by extending it and setting up the elements in the constructor.
You need to set the content for the header and the drawer.
You can have an application menu either horizontally in the header (navigation bar) or vertically in the drawer.

The following example shows how to create a main view with a vertical menu in the drawer, and a button to open and close it in the navigation bar:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/MainView.java[tags=mainview,indent=0]
----

Creating the header and the menu content is described below.

You can customize the styling by giving path to CSS files with the [classname]#@CssImport# annotation.
The stylesheets need to be put under the `frontend` folder in the project.
Likewise you can include JavaScript code with the [classname]#JsModule#] annotation.
In the example we include a JavaScript file that sets shared custom styles.
See <<../advanced/loading-resources#, Loading Resources>> for more details about importing the CSS and JavaScript resources.

Notice that the main view itself does not have a route, as it is only a frame for the actual content views.

[[flow.application.main-view.header]]
== Creating a Header

The navigation bar of the [classname]#AppLayout# is a horizontal element that can contain any component, such as a header or a horizontal menu.
Applications created with the project builder use it for a header containing a menu toggle, a view title, and a user image.

Whether the drawer is displayed can be toggled with a [classname]#DrawerToggle# component.

The following example creates such a header, using the `viewTitle` member in the main view class:

----

[[flow.application.main-view.menu]]
== Creating a Menu

A menu can be displayed either in the navigation bar or in the drawer.
In an application created by the project builder, it is in the drawer as described here.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/MainView.java[tags=drawer,indent=0]
----

The actual menu is a vertical [classname]#Tabs# component.
It is filled from a list of [classname]#Tab# components.
Each tab contains a [classname]#RouterLink# to the corresponding view.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/MainView.java[tags=menu,indent=0]
----

[[flow.application.main-view.navigation]]
== Handling Navigation

When the user navigates to a view, the tab for the view should be highlighted by setting it as selected.
You can also set the view title in header.

You can do these tasks by overriding [methodname]#afterNavigation()# in [classname]#AppLayout# as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/MainView.java[tags=navigation,indent=0]
----

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Weasel = NO -->]
The selected tab should correspond to the displayed content (the view).
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Weasel = YES -->]

You can find it as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/MainView.java[tags=selection,indent=0]
----

You can get the view title from the [classname]#PageTitle# annotation given to the view (see <<flow.application.main-view.view>>).

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/MainView.java[tags=pagetitle,indent=0]
----

The same title is automatically set as the page title in the browser, so you do not need to handle that.


[[flow.application.main-view.view]]
== Creating a View

Like any view, a view displayed in a [classname]#AppLayout# needs a route defined with the [classname]#@Route# annotation.
The route needs to be linked to the main view, by giving the class object of the main view with the `layout` parameter.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/HelloWorldView.java[tags=route,indent=0]
----

Notice that the main view itself didn't have a route.
To have an entry point to the main view, and often to the entire application, you need to define a default view using a route alias, as described in <<flow.application.main-view.view.default>>.

=== Page Title

You can set the page title shown in the browser window or tab using the [classname]#@PageTitle# annotation.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/HelloWorldView.java[tags=pagetitle,indent=0]
----

You can use the page title in a view header or breadcrumbs, as shown in <<flow.application.main-view.navigation>>.

=== Styling a View

You can define custom styling for the view with the [classname]#@CssImport# annotation.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/HelloWorldView.java[tags=styling,indent=0]
----

[[flow.application.main-view.view.default]]
=== Default View

Most applications need an entry point.
You can define a view as the default view by defining the route of the main view for it with [classname]#@RouteAlias#.
The `value` defining the route needs to be empty for the root route.

You also need to define the enclosing main view with the `layout` parameter, like for the route earlier.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/mainview/HelloWorldView.java[tags=default,indent=0]
----

You could also have `/main` for the main view and then `/main/hello` for the sub-view.

=== Finishing the View

Otherwise a view is like any other view or a composite component.
