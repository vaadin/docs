= Images and Icons

Images and icons are the basic custom visual elements to add visual content, guides, and style.
You can display images using the [classname]`Image` component.
Many web components allow you to display an icon along with a title or inside the component.


== The Image Component

The [classname]`Image` component allows you to embed images.
It is a wrapper around the HTML [elementname]#<img># element.
You can display either static images or images generated on the fly.

=== Static Resources

A servlet container can serve images as static resources.
This is more efficient than streaming them through the application, as described later.
You can also serve static resources from a frontend server.

--
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/resources/ImageBasic.java[tags=snippet, indent=0]
----
--

The second parameter to the constructor is alternative text, which is displayed if the image cannot be displayed for some reason.
It is also used in assistive technologies.

The location of static image resources in the project depends on the deployment method:

Web Archive (WAR) packaging::
  Under `/src/main/webapp`, such as `/src/main/webapp/images/myimage.png`.

JAR packaging (Spring Boot applications)::
  Under `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources`, such as `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/images/myimage.png`.

The access URL of the image resource depends on how the application is deployed.
If the resources are deployed under the application root URL, you could access the example file with `images/myimage.png`, as in the earlier Java example.
Embedding can further complicate the access URL.

=== Dynamic Resources

[classname]`Image` accepts a [classname]`StreamResource` to load images from the Java class path.
////

=== Class Resources

You can use [classname]`StreamResource` to load images from the Java class path.
In this case, the images need to be below `src/main/resources` in the Java compilation path.
The path for [methodname]`getResourceAsStream()` is relative to that path.
Notice that you need to include the leading `/`.

// TODO
=== Inline Image Data

You can have inline images by encoding them as BASE64 data URLs.

== Icons

Icons are small graphical symbols intended to represent the various functions of an application, as well as different types of data.

Vaadin Design System includes two sets of stock icons:

<<../../ds/foundation/icons#, Lumo icons>>::
 A basic set of icons specifically designed for the default Lumo theme.

 new Icon("lumo", "<identifier>")

<<../../ds/foundation/icons/vaadin#, Vaadin icons>>::
 A more general set of 600+ icons designed for web applications.

 new Icon("vaadin", "<identifier>")

You can use icons in the same way as any other components:

[.example.show-code]
--
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/resources/IconsBasic.java[render, tags=snippet, indent=0]
----

[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/flow/application/images/icons-basic.ts[hidden, indent=0, group=TypeScript]
----
--

Most components allow you to place icons beside the title or inside the component, as a prefix, a suffix, or a helper component.
The placement options depend on the component.

[.example.show-code]

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/flow/application/resources/IconsInside.java[render, tags=snippet, indent=0]
----

[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/flow/application/images/icons-basic.ts[hidden, indent=0, group=TypeScript]
----
--

Notice that you can use either a helper component (such as an icon) or text, but not both.
If you need both, you can put them inside a compositing component, such as a [classname]`HorizontalLayout`, as in the example above.
