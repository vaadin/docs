= Configuring Push in Embedded Applications

You can configure and enable Push in your embedded applications.

There are two ways to configure Push:

* Use the <<../../advanced/server-push#push.configuration.annotation,`@Push` annotation>> in your [classname]`WebComponentExporter` class.
+
*Example*: Using the `@Push` annotation in the [classname]`PushComponentExporter` class.
+
[source,java]
----
@Push
public class PushComponentExporter
        extends WebComponentExporter<Div> {
----

* Declare Push on the servlet level, by defining them in the <<../../advanced/server-push#push.configuration.servlet,servlet configuration>>.


+
[NOTE]

The `@Push` annotation declaration has the same limitation as the <<theming#,@Theme` annotation>>: it is only possible to configure Push for one exporter.
Declaring different `@Push` annotations for different exporter classes will result in an exception during start-up.

See <<../../advanced/server-push#,Server Push Configuration>> for more about configuring Push.
