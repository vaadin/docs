= Configuring Push in Embedded Applications

You can configure and enable Push in your embedded applications. Push can be configured in two ways. One way is to use the <<../../advanced/server-push#push.configuration.annotation,`@Push` annotation>> in your [classname]`WebComponentExporter` class.

Here's an example of this using the `@Push` annotation in the [classname]`PushComponentExporter` class:

[source,java]
----
@Push
public class PushComponentExporter
        extends WebComponentExporter<Div> {
----

Another way is to declare Push on the servlet level, by defining them in the <<../../advanced/server-push#push.configuration.servlet,servlet configuration>>.


[NOTE]
The `@Push` annotation declaration has the same limitation as the <<theming#,@Theme` annotation>>: it's only possible to configure Push for one exporter. Declaring different `@Push` annotations for different exporter classes results in an exception during start-up.

See <<../../advanced/server-push#,Server Push Configuration>> for more about configuring Push.
