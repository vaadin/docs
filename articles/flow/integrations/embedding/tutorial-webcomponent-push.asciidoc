= Configuring Push in Embedded Applications 

You can configure and enable Push in your embedded applications. 

There are two ways to configure Push: 

* Use the <<../../advanced/tutorial-push-configuration#push.configuration.annotation,`@Push` annotation>> in your `WebComponentExporter` class. 
+
*Example*: Using the `@Push` annotation in the `PushComponentExporter` class. 
+
[source, java]
----
@Push
public class PushComponentExporter
        extends WebComponentExporter<Div> {
----

* Declare Push on the servlet level, by defining them in the <<../../advanced/tutorial-push-configuration#push.configuration.servlet,servlet configuration>>.


+
[NOTE]

The `@Push` annotation declaration has the same limitation as the <<tutorial-webcomponent-theming#,@Theme` annotation>>: it is only possible to configure Push for one exporter. Declaring different `@Push` annotations for different exporter classes will result in an exception during startup. 

See <<../../advanced/tutorial-push-configuration#,Server Push Configuration>> for more about configuring Push.
