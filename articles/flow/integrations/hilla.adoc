= [since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.4]#Flow-Hilla Hybrid Applications#

Hilla is part of the Vaadin Platform used for building reactive web applications on Java backends. It integrates seamlessly a https://reactjs.org/[React] TypeScript frontend with a https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] backend.

You can develop hybrid applications that leverage Vaadin Flow and Hilla. This allows you to combine Vaadin Flow routes written in pure Java, with the Hilla ones written in React, into one application.

This page shows how to <<#hilla-to-flow, add Hilla to an existing Vaadin Flow application>>, or <<#flow-to-hilla, add Vaadin Flow to an existing Hilla application>>.

See the https://github.com/vaadin/flow-hilla-hybrid-example[source code of a complete Vaadin Flow-Hilla application].


[[hilla-to-flow]]
== Add Hilla to Flow Applications

To add Hilla to a Vaadin Flow application, you could start with a Spring Boot-based Vaadin Flow application (e.g., https://github.com/vaadin/[skeleton-starter-flow-spring]). You can add Hilla to the project using the steps described in the sub-sections here.

Project dependencies adjustments aren't needed since Hilla is included in the Vaadin platform.


=== Add React Views

Add a view file, [filename]`counter.tsx` into the `src/main/frontend/views` sub-directory. It will be accessible under `/counter` path in a browser. Here's an example of how that might look:

.counter.tsx
[source,javascript]
----
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Button } from '@vaadin/react-components/Button.js';
import { HorizontalLayout } from '@vaadin/react-components/HorizontalLayout.js';

export default function counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  return (
    <HorizontalLayout theme="spacing" style={{ alignItems: 'baseline' }}>
      <Button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>Button</Button>
      <p>Clicked {counter} times</p>
    </HorizontalLayout>
  );
}
----

The directory, `src/main/frontend/views` is a default location where Vaadin looks for frontend views and automatically configures React Router, based on the file's structure.

Use <</components/side-nav#,Side Navigation>> or <</flow/routing/retrieving-routes#standard-navigation-targets,Anchor>> components to navigate from a Flow view to a Hilla view:

[source,java]
----
Anchor navigateToHilla = new Anchor("counter", "Navigate to a Hilla view");
----


=== Run the Application

Run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run`. Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

Once you add a frontend view, Vaadin starts the Vite development server on the next application run, enabling frontend hot-deployment.


[[flow-to-hilla]]
== Add Flow to Hilla Applications

If you already have a Hilla application, you can add Vaadin Flow to it. For example, starting from the Hilla https://github.com/vaadin/skeleton-starter-hilla-react[project starter]), you can add Vaadin Flow to the project using the steps in the sub-sections that follow.

Vaadin Platform includes Hilla dependencies; no dependencies adjustment is needed.


=== Add Server-Side Routes

Add a view file [filename]`HelloView.java` into the `src/main/java/org/vaadin/example/HelloView.java` sub-directory. It will be accessible under `/hello` path in a browser. Here's an example of that:

.HelloView.java
[source,java]
----
import com.vaadin.flow.component.button.Button;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.html.Paragraph;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.orderedlayout.VerticalLayout;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.textfield.TextField;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.Route;

@Route("hello")
public class HelloView extends VerticalLayout {
    public HelloView() {
        TextField textField = new TextField("Your name");
        Button button = new Button("Say hello", e ->
                add(new Paragraph("Hello, " + textField.getValue())));
        add(textField, button);
    }
}
----

Use Vaadin's https://hilla.dev/docs/react/components/side-nav[Side Navigation] or React's https://hilla.dev/docs/react/guides/routing#adding-routes[NavLink] / https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link[Link] components to navigate from a Hilla view to a Flow view:

[source,javascript]
----
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

<NavLink to="/flow-route">Navigate to a Flow View</NavLink>
