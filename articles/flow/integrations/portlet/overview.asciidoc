= Portlet Support

:commercial-feature: Portlet Support
include::{articles}/_commercial-banner.asciidoc[opts=optional]

Vaadin Portlet support for Vaadin 14 is built on top of the https://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/portlet-3-final-spec/[Portlet 3.0 Specification].
The Vaadin Portlet add-on has been developed and tested with Liferay 7 and the Apache Pluto Portal 3.1.0 (reference implementation for Portlet 3.0 API), but it can be run in other portals that support Portlet 3.0.

== Limitations and Known Issues

- Vaadin Portlet does not support integration with `OSGi`, which comes with Liferay 7.
Please vote for https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/10939/[OSGi support for Vaadin Portlet] if you need it in your project, and leave a comment about your use cases.
- The `Vaadin Push` feature is https://github.com/vaadin/portlet/issues/200/[not currently supported].
Vaadin client-to-server polling can be used as a replacement.
- The `SPA` feature is not supported and needs to be disabled for Liferay.
See https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030752391-Disabling-SPA/[SPA issue].
- The Vaadin Portlet API for changing a Portlet's mode and state does not work with Liferay.
See https://github.com/vaadin/portlet/issues/214[this issue].
- Neither the [annotationname]`@PWA` annotation nor any PWA features are supported.
