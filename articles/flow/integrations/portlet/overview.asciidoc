:commercial-feature: Portlet Support
include::{articles}/_commercial-banner.asciidoc[opts=optional]

Vaadin Portlet Support for Vaadin 14 is built on top of the https://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/portlet-3-final-spec/[Portlet 3.0 Specification].
Vaadin Portlet add-on developed and tested with Liferay 7 and Apache Pluto Portal 3.1.0 (reference implementation for Portlet 3.0 API), but can be run in other portals supporting Portlet 3.0.

== Limitations and Known Issues

- Vaadin Portlet does not support integration with `OSGi`, which comes with Liferay 7. Please vote for https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/10939/[OSGi support for Vaadin Portlet] if you need it in your project and leave a comment about your use cases.
- `Vaadin Push` feature is https://github.com/vaadin/portlet/issues/200/[not supported] at the moment. Vaadin client-to-server polling can be used as a replacement.
- `SPA` feature is not supported and needs to be disabled for Liferay, see https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030752391-Disabling-SPA/[SPA issue].
- Vaadin Portlet API for changing Portlet's mode and state doesn't work with Liferay, see https://github.com/vaadin/portlet/issues/214[this issue].
- `@PWA` annotation and all PWAs features are not supported.
