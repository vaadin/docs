= Vaadin Spring Scopes

== Contexts and Scopes in Spring

* *Contexts* in Spring are services that manage the lifecycle of objects and handle their injection. Generally, a context refers to a situation in which an instance is used with a unique identity. These objects are essentially "singletons" in the context.

* *Scopes* are narrower than contexts. While conventional singletons are application-wide, objects managed by a Spring container are "singletons" in a narrower scope. Examples include a user session, a particular UI instance associated with the session, or even a single request. A scope defines the lifecycle of the object, that is its creation, use, and destruction.


== Using Spring Scopes

In most programming languages, a variable name refers to a unique object within the scope of the variable. In Spring, an object has a unique identity within a scope, but instead of identifying the object by its variable name, it is identified by its type (object class) and qualifiers, if any.

In addition to standard Spring scopes, the https://vaadin.com/directory/component/vaadin-spring/overview[Vaadin Spring add-on] introduces two additional scopes: `VaadinSessionScope` and `UIScope`.

* The `@VaadinSessionScope` annotation manages the Spring beans during the Vaadin session lifecycle. It ensures that the same bean instance is used during the whole Vaadin session.

+
*Example*: Using the `@VaadinSessionScope` annotation.

@Route("")
public class MainLayout extends Div {
    public MainLayout(@Autowired SessionService bean) {
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@Route("editor")
public class Editor extends Div {
    public Editor(@Autowired SessionService bean) {
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@Component
@VaadinSessionScope
public class SessionService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText(){
        return "session " + uid;
    }
}
----
** Provided you access the application from the same Vaadin session, the same instance of `SessionService` is used. This is because it is session scoped.
** If you open the root target in one tab and the `editor` target in another, the text in both is the same. This happens because the session is the same, even though the tabs (and `UI` instances) are different.

* The `@UIScope` annotation manages the Spring beans during the `UI` lifecycle.

+
*Example*: Using the `@UIScope` annotation.

@Route("")
public class MainLayout extends Div {
    public MainLayout(@Autowired UIService bean) {
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@Route("editor")
public class Editor extends Div {
    public Editor(@Autowired UIService bean) {
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@Component
@UIScope
public class UIService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText() {
        return "ui " + uid;
    }
}
----
** The `UIService` is now the same while in the same `UI`, because it is UI scoped. When using `@UIScope`, the same bean instance is used inside the same `UI` instance.
** If you open the root target in one tab and the `editor` target in another, the text in each is different, because the `UI` instances are different. However, if you navigate to the `Editor` instance via the router (or a `UI` instance which delegates navigation to the router), the text is the same.

** *Example*: Navigating to the `editor` target.

public void edit() {
    getUI().get().navigate("editor");
