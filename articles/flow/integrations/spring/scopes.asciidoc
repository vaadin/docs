= Vaadin Spring Scopes

== Contexts and Scopes in Spring

* *Contexts* in Spring are services that manage the lifecycle of objects and handle their injection. A context refers to a situation in which an instance is used with a unique identity. These objects are essentially "singletons" in the context.

* *Scopes* are narrower than contexts. While conventional singletons are application-wide, objects managed by a Spring container are "singletons" in a narrower scope. Examples include a user session, a particular UI instance associated with the session, or even a single request. A scope defines the lifecycle of the object, that is its creation, use, and destruction.

More information on beans and scopes in Spring can read from the https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-definition[Spring project documentation].

== Using Scopes with Vaadin and Spring

In most programming languages, a variable name refers to a unique object within the scope of the variable.
In Spring, an object has a unique identity within a scope, but instead of identifying the object by its variable name, it is identified by its type (object class) and qualifiers, if any.

With Spring Boot, you need to mark your Vaadin related bean classes with the https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html[`@Component`] annotation to make them picked up as managed beans.
Because there is also `Component` class in Vaadin, you can use the `SpringComponent` annotation from the Vaadin Spring add-on to avoid having to use fully qualified names.
If no scope is specified in addition to the `@SpringComponent` / `@Component` annotation, the component is in https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory-scopes-singleton[singleton scope].

In addition to standard Spring scopes, the https://vaadin.com/directory/component/vaadin-spring/overview[Vaadin Spring add-on] introduces three additional scope:

** `VaadinSessionScope` for targeting beans to a user's session
** `UIScope` for targeting beans to a browser window or tab opened by the user
** `RouteScope` for targeting beans to certain routing components pointed by the `RouteScopeOwner` qualifier

=== VaadinSessionScope

The `@VaadinSessionScope` annotation maps the Spring beans to the Vaadin session lifecycle.
It ensures that the same bean instance is used during the whole Vaadin session.

+
*Example*: using the `@VaadinSessionScope` annotation.
+
[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class MainLayout extends Div {
    public MainLayout(@Autowired SessionService bean) {
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@Route("editor")
public class Editor extends Div {
    public Editor(@Autowired SessionService bean) {
        setText(bean.getText());
    }
}

@SpringComponent
@VaadinSessionScope
public class SessionService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText(){
        return "session " + uid;
    }
}
----
** Provided you access the application from the same Vaadin session, the same instance of `SessionService` is used.
This is because it is session scoped.
** If you open the root target in one browser tab, and the `editor` target in another, yet the text in both is the same.
This happens because the session is the same, even though the tabs (and `UI` instances) are different.

See <<../../advanced/application-lifecycle#application.lifecycle.session,Application Lifecycle > User Session>> for more information on session handling.

=== UIScope

The `@UIScope` annotation manages the Spring beans during the `UI` lifecycle.

+
*Example*: using the `@UIScope` annotation.
+
[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class MainLayout extends Div {
    public MainLayout(@Autowired UIService bean) {
        add(new Span(bean.getText()));
        add(new RouterLink("Open editor", Editor.class));
    }
}

@Route("editor")
public class Editor extends Div {
    public Editor(@Autowired UIService bean) {
        add(new Span(bean.getText()));
        add(new RouterLink("Open MainLayout", MainLayout.class));
    }
}

@SpringComponent
@UIScope
public class UIService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText() {
        return "ui " + uid;
    }
}
----
** The `UIService` bean instance is the same inside the same `UI`.
** If you open the `MainLayout` view in one browser tab or window, and the `Editor` view in another, the text in each is different, because the `UI` instances are different.
** When navigating inside the same browser tab between the `MainLayout` and `Editor`, the text stays the same since the service is the same.

See <<../../advanced/application-lifecycle#application.lifecycle.ui,Application Lifecycle > Loading a UI>> for more information on UIs.

.Preserving UIScope beans
NOTE: Unlike with earlier Vaadin versions 7 and 8, the `UI` and thus the `UIScope` beans are not preserved when the `@PreserveOnRefresh` annotation is used, and the browser is refreshed.
To be able to preserve the beans on refresh, you need to use `@RouteScope` instead, as described in <<routescope.preserve, the next chapter>>.

=== RouteScope and RouteScopeOwner

The `@RouteScope` annotation ties the beans to the lifecycle of Vaadin Flow routing components (`@Route`, `RouteLayout`, `HasErrorParameter`).
Since there can be multiple nested levels of routing components present at once, an additional `@RouteScopeOwner` _qualifier_ annotation can be used to specify the _owner_ routing component.
Without the owner qualifier, the owner is the currently active routing component at the time of injection.
As long as the owner routing component is part of the active view chain, all beans owned by it remain in the scope.

When the `@RouteScope` bean itself is a router component, the owner can be any parent `RouterLayout` in the route chain hierarchy, or the bean itself.

See <<../../routing/overview#,Defining Routes With @Route>> and <<../../routing/layout#,Router Layouts and Nested Router Targets>> for more about route targets, route layouts, and the active route chain.

*Example*: sharing a bean between two child views with the same parent layout
[source, java]
----
@SpringComponent
@RouteScope
@RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
public class RouteService {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText() {
        return "ui " + uid;
    }
}

@Route("")
@RoutePrefix("parent")
public class ParentView extends VerticalLayout
        implements RouterLayout {

    public ParentView(
            @Autowired @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            RouteService routeService) {
        add(new Span("Parent view:" + routeService.getText()),
                new RouterLink("Open Child-A", ChildAView.class),
                new RouterLink("Open Child-B", ChildBView.class),
                new RouterLink("Open Sibling", SiblingView.class));
    }
}

@Route(value = "child-a", layout = ParentView.class)
public class ChildAView extends VerticalLayout {

    public ChildAView(
            @Autowired @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            RouteService routeService) {
        add(new Text("Child-a: " + routeService.getText()));
    }
}

@Route(value = "child-b", layout = ParentView.class)
public class ChildBView extends VerticalLayout {

    public ChildBView(
            @Autowired @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            RouteService routeService) {
        add(new Text("Child-a: " + routeService.getText()));
    }
}

@Route(value = "sibling")
public class SiblingView extends VerticalLayout {

    public SiblingView() {
        add(new RouterLink("Open ParentView", ParentView.class),
                new RouterLink("Open Child-A", ChildAView.class),
                new RouterLink("Open Child-B", ChildBView.class));
    }
}
----
** The injected `RouteService` bean instance is the same while the `ParentView` is attached, like when navigating between the child views.
** When navigating to the `SiblingView`, the `ParentView` is detached. When navigating back to the `ParentView` (or child views), a new `RouteService` bean is created.

.Injecting to wider scope
CAUTION: Injecting a "narrower" `RouteScope` bean into "wider" scope, like parent layout's `RouteScope` or `UIScope`, can cause problems.
If you store a `RouteScope` bean into a wider scope bean, the stored bean instance is not automatically replaced.

==== @RouteScope Without @RouteScopeOwner to Replace @ViewScope From Vaadin 7 / 8

When the `@RouteScopeOwner` annotation is omitted, the owner is the currently active route target.
In case of nested routing hierarchies, the owner is the "leaf" / "bottom-most" active routing component.
The bean remains in scope for as long as the routing component stays active.
Compared to a `@Scope("prototype")` bean injected to the routing component, the `@RouteScope` bean without an owner will have its `@PreDestroy` method called when the routing component is no longer active.
Using `@RouteScope` without clarifying an owner is an replacement for the `@ViewScope` from Vaadin 7 or 8.

.Model-View-Presenter
NOTE: The following example is based on the _model-view-presenter_ design pattern just for the sake of demo - **it is not a best practice example**.
It allows splitting different logical parts of the application, but adds a lot of boilerplate code.

*Example*: `@RouteScope` without owner behaves like legacy Vaadin `@ViewScope`
[source, java]
----
/*
 * Presenter responsible for application logic and setting data for the view.
 */
@SpringComponent
@RouteScope
public class UserProfilePresenter {

    private final UserService service;
    private final UserModel model;

    @Autowired
    public UserProfilePresenter(UserService service, UserModel model) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public void init(UserProfileView view) {
        Integer id = model.getActiveUserId();
        if (id != null) {
           view.showUser(service.getUser(id));
        } else {
            view.redirectToLogin();
        }
    }
}

@Route("user-profile")
public class UserProfileView extends VerticalLayout {

    private final UserProfilePresenter presenter;

    public UserProfileView(@Autowired UserProfilePresenter presenter) {
        this.presenter = presenter;
    }

    @PostConstruct
    private void init() {
        presenter.init(this);
    }

    public void showUser(User user) {
        removeAll();
        add(new Div(new Text("Hello " + user.getName())));
    }

    public void redirectToLogin() {
        Notification.show("Not logged in!");
        UI.getCurrent().navigate("login");
    }
}

@SpringComponent
@VaadinSessionScope
// A bean storing the active user for the session
public class UserModel {

    private Integer activeUserId;
    // getter and setter omitted
}

@Service
// Service for fetching the user entity from backend
public class UserService {

    public User getUser(Integer id) {
        // implementation omitted
    }
}
// User entity
public class User {
    private String name;
    // getter and setter omitted
}

----
** In this example, a new `UserProfilePresenter` bean is created every time when the `UserProfileView` view is opened.
** The presenter bean stays the same during the time the view is attached to the UI.

[[routescope.preserve]]
=== Preserving Beans During Browser Refresh

When the user refreshes the page, by default all routing components are recreated.
This applies to `@UIScope` and `@RouteScope` beans too - new bean instances are created and injected to the new routing components.
It is possible to tell the framework to preserve the routing components during refresh with the `@PreserveOnRefresh` annotation (for more information, <<../../advanced/preserving-state-on-refresh.asciidoc#,see here>>).

When the `@PreserveOnRefresh` annotation is used on a routing component that has `@RouteScope` beans injected to it - the beans are preserved too.

*Example*: preserving beans with `@RouteScopeOwner` targeting a component with `@PreserveOnRefresh`
[source, java]
----
@SpringComponent
@RouteScope
@RouteScopeOwner(MainLayout.class)
public class PreservedBean {
    private String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    public String getText() {
        return uid;
    }
}

@Route("") // optional, could use a subview with @Route instead
@PreserveOnRefresh
public class MainLayout extends VerticalLayout
        implements RouterLayout {

    public MainLayout(
            @Autowired @RouteScopeOwner(ParentView.class)
            PreservedBean bean) {
        add(new Span("UID:" + bean.getText()));
    }
}
----
** In this example, both the `MainLayout` component and the `PreservedBean` injected bean are preserved after browser refresh - the text stays the same.
** If the `@PreserveOnRefresh` annotation is removed from the layout, both the component and the bean are recreated after browser refresh - the text would change.

==== Beans in UIScope Are Not Preserved
Injected beans are not preserved when they are in `UIScope`, but only in `RouteScope`, regardless of usage of `@PreserveOnRefresh`.
However, any currently active routing components are preserved even if they are in `UIScope`.
This is due to the nature of the `@PreserveOnRefresh` feature implementation - the `UI` instance itself is not preserved, but routing components are.
Any bean tied to the `UI` instance with `UIScope` is recreated, and the preserved routing components are moved to the new `UI`.
To be able to preserve beans during a browser refresh, `@RouteScope` needs to be used like above.
