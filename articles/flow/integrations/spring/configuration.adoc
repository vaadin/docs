= Vaadin Spring Configuration

You can use many properties to configure a Vaadin application. For example,  [classname]`com.vaadin.server.DeploymentConfiguration` and [classname]`com.vaadin.server.Constants` classes are available for the numerous property names. Additionally, you can set Spring properties as system properties. Spring configuration properties use the same names, but are prefixed with `vaadin.`. 

See the <<{articles}/flow/configuration/properties/#properties,complete list of configuration properties>>.


== Special Configuration Parameters

Spring has several special configuration parameters, such as ones for scanning packages, preventing the handling of specific URLs, and more. They're described in the sections that follow.


=== Configure Packages Scanning

To decrease startup time during development, as well as the build time for the production bundle, Vaadin Flow excludes many packages from being scanned for annotations -- such as ones belonging to the `java` and `springframework` packages. The set of packages that Flow excludes by default is defined in the [classname]`VaadinServletContextInitializer` class.

You can extend this list of packages to exclude from scanning, by using the `vaadin.blocked-packages` property. It accepts a comma-separated string. To do that, you would do something like the following:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
vaadin.blocked-packages=org/bouncycastle,com/my/db/package
----

The `allowed-packages` also contains a comma-separated string, but it's a list of only packages that need to be scanned for UI components and views. You should set this property to improve performance during development, especially in large applications. The [classname]`com/vaadin/flow/component` package is implicitly included and is always scanned.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
vaadin.allowed-packages=com/foo/myapp/ui,com/foo/components
----

Use either `allowed-packages` or `blocked-packages` -- not both. If both are used and have values, though, `blocked-packages` is ignored.

[IMPORTANT]
The previous `vaadin.whitelisted-packages` and `vaadin.blacklisted-packages` properties have been deprecated, and will be removed in the future.

==== JAR Packages Scanning

To optimize package scanning within a JAR file, add a `META-INF/VAADIN/package.properties` file inside the JAR to define JAR specific scanning rules. In a Maven artifact with jar packaging, create a `src/main/resources/META-INF/VAADIN` directory and add a `package.properties` file with the desired configuration.

The `package.properties` file affects only the target JAR content. It supports `vaadin.allowed-packages` and `vaadin.blocked-packages` properties in the same way as in the `application.properties` file. The `vaadin.blocked-jar=true` property is used to disable scanning of the JAR, entirely.


=== Prevent Handling of Specific URLs

For some use cases, it's desirable to exclude specific URLs from being handled by Vaadin, without changing the Vaadin URL mapping. For example, to integrate Swagger-UI, Vaadin shouldn't handle requests for resources accessed by `/swagger-ui.html`.

The list of URL patterns that should not be handled by the Vaadin servlet, can be configured using the `vaadin.exclude-urls` property in the form of a comma-separated string.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
vaadin.exclude-urls=/swagger-ui/**,/custom-service/**
----

This configuration only applies when the Vaadin servlet is mapped to the root mapping.


=== Launch Browser in Development Mode

You can configure a Spring Boot project to launch the default browser when starting the application in development mode by setting the following property:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
vaadin.launch-browser = true
----

After a server restart, the application refrains from opening a new browser tab until a thirty-minute interval has elapsed to avoid excessive tab proliferation. This delay is reset upon each server restart. In the event of a restart occurring before the interval lapses, a new tab will be opened thirty minutes post-restart.

The delay duration can be changed by configuring the `vaadin.launch-browser-delay` property to specify the number of minutes before initiating a new tab launch.

To trigger the tab opening immediately, you can perform a project cleanup (e.g., `mvn clean` or `gradle clean`). Or you can delete the [filename]`tab.launch` file in the build directory (e.g., `target` for Maven, `build` for Gradle). Another option is to set `vaadin.launch-browser-delay=0` in [filename]`application.properties`.

The example below shows how to set the duration, with the value in minutes:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
vaadin.launch-browser-delay = 30
----


=== Initial Data Cache in Development Mode

During development of a project, Vaadin caches automatically some initialization data. For instance, cached data includes details about resources to load, as well as dynamically generated white-lists of packages that need to be scanned for annotations. This caching is done to shorten the turnaround time of automatic restart on class modification.

Automatic caching won't occur if your application is running in production mode. Plus, it requires that Spring Boot Development Tools be enabled.

Some project resources and classes always need to be scanned, though, and cannot rely on caching. Also, caching can produce unexpected errors after reloads. For these reasons, you may want to disable caching. This can be done using the following property:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
vaadin.devmode-caching = false
----


== Customizing Vaadin Servlet and Service

In some cases you may need to override functionality in [classname]`VaadinServlet` or [classname]`VaadinService` classes. In a Spring application, customization of these classes is a bit different. With Spring it can be done by providing a custom configuration class as shown in the example below:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class OverriddenServletConfiguration {

    @Autowired
    private WebApplicationContext context;

    @Bean
    public ServletRegistrationBean<SpringServlet> servletRegistrationBean(
            ObjectProvider<MultipartConfigElement> multipartConfig,
            VaadinConfigurationProperties configurationProperties) {
        boolean rootMapping = RootMappedCondition
                .isRootMapping(configurationProperties.getUrlMapping());
        // Calls default configuration for ServletRegistrationBean at
        // com.vaadin.flow.spring.SpringBootAutoConfiguration.configureServletRegistrationBean
        return configureServletRegistrationBean(multipartConfig,
                configurationProperties,
                new OverriddenSpringServlet(context, rootMapping));
    }

    public static class OverriddenSpringServlet extends SpringServlet {

        public OverriddenSpringServlet(ApplicationContext context,
                                       boolean rootMapping) {
            // SpringServlet customization can be done here
        }

        @Override
        protected VaadinServletService createServletService(
                DeploymentConfiguration deploymentConfiguration)
                throws ServiceException {
            // VaadinServletService customization can be done here
        }
    }
}
----


== Spring Boot Properties

You can set properties for Spring Boot in your [filename]`application.properties` file. An example of this would be setting Spring URL mapping in [filename]`application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
vaadin.url-mapping=/my_mapping/*
----

By default, URL mapping is `/*`.


=== Vaadin URL Mapping

When using a custom servlet URL mapping in a Vaadin application, special care must be taken to reference static resources (e.g., images) in Vaadin views. For example, if the application provides images in `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/images` or in `src/main/resources/static/images`, these images are served from the root of the web application context (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/images/logo.png`). If your Vaadin views involve a custom mapping (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/my_mapping/`), you need to ensure that the correct path is provided for the images. 

To reference an image from the application root, you can use a relative path, such as `new Image("../images/logo.png", "Company Logo")`. However, this approach is not ideal when the same application can be deployed with different URL mappings, or without any custom mapping, as it may lead to inconsistencies.

A solution could be to use a helper method to compute a path relative to the context root:

[source,java]
----
public static String resolveStaticResource(String path) {
  return UI.getCurrent().getInternals().getContextRootRelativePath()
    + path.replaceFirst("^/", "");
}

public class MyView extends Div {
  public MyView() {
    add(new Image(resolveStaticResource("images/logo.png")));
  }
}
----

Another option is to register a Servlet Filter that intercepts static resource referenced by the Vaadin UI and forwards the request to the correct path.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "vaadin.url-mapping")
FilterRegistrationBean<?> publicImagesAliasFilter(@Value("${vaadin.url-mapping}") String urlMapping) {
  String baseMapping = urlMapping.replaceFirst("/\\*$", "");
  FilterRegistrationBean<OncePerRequestFilter> registrationBean = new FilterRegistrationBean<>(
    new OncePerRequestFilter() {
      @Override
      protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request,
                                      HttpServletResponse response,
                                      FilterChain filterChain)
                        throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Remove Vaadin URL mapping from the path and forward the request
        String path = request.getRequestURI().substring(baseMapping.length());
        request.getRequestDispatcher(path)
          forward(request, response);
      }
    });
  registrationBean.addUrlPatterns(baseMapping + "/images/*");
  registrationBean.setOrder(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE);
  return registrationBean;
}
----


== Configure Spring MVC Applications

If you use <<spring-mvc#,Spring MVC>>, and hence the [classname]`VaadinMVCWebAppInitializer` sub-class, you need to populate your configuration properties.

Setting configuration properties, for example, in a Spring MVC application would look like this:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")
public class MyConfiguration {

}
----

The [filename]`application.properties` file here is still used, but you can use any name and any property source.


== Configure Spring Boot Development Tools

Sometimes when using Spring Boot Development Tools with automatic restart enabled, more than one restart can be triggered. It depends on how many files are changed at once, and how the IDE is changing monitored files. As a result, this may slow the overall restart time.

Spring Development tools has two properties in the [filename]`application.properties` file that can be adjusted to improve the restart time: `spring.devtools.restart.poll-interval`; and `spring.devtools.restart.quiet-period`.

Poll interval is the frequency in which classpath directories are polled for changes. The default is 1 second. The quiet period ensures that there are no additional changes. Its default is 400 milliseconds.

In a small project developed with Eclipse, for example, using the following smaller values can increase the restart time when changing one or a few classes:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
spring.devtools.restart.poll-interval=100ms
spring.devtools.restart.quiet-period=50ms
----

As another example, in a project developed with IntelliJ IDEA, increasing values can ensure that restart happens only once after changing one or a few classes:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
spring.devtools.restart.poll-interval=2000ms
spring.devtools.restart.quiet-period=1000ms
----

For larger applications, try to increase the values for these properties to avoid multiple restarts. An additional second for the poll interval doesn't matter much if everything else takes more than ten seconds to restart.

There isn't a best value for all development environments. The examples here are presented to show how to make adjustments -- not as recommended values.
