[[quarkus.basic]]
= Using Quarkus with Vaadin

Quarkus is an open source, Kubernetes-native Java framework made for Java virtual machines and native compilation. It optimizes Java specifically for containers, enabling it to become an effective platform for serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments.

For more information on Quarkus, see the https://quarkus.io[Quarkus site].


== Starting a Project

To start a new project with Quarkus and Vaadin, you can download the https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-flow-quarkus/[Quarkus base starter]. It's a project template with the necessary configuration and dependencies for building an application.

It's also available with Gradle configuration in the https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-flow-quarkus/tree/gradle[Gradle] branch on GitHub.


[[quarkus.setup]]
== Existing Projects

To be able to run an existing project with Quarkus, you'll need to have the `vaadin-quarkus` and `vaadin-jandex` Maven dependencies in the project, as well configure the `quarkus-maven-plugin`.

Below is an example of how that might be done:

.`pom.xml`

== Vaadin CDI Features

Since Quarkus's dependency injection solution is based on CDI, it's possible to use all of the CDI features.

See these documentation pages for Vaadin CDI features:

- <<cdi/contexts#, Vaadin CDI Scopes>>
- <<cdi/events#, Observable Vaadin Events>>
- <<cdi/service-beans#, Vaadin Service Interfaces as CDI Beans>>
- <<cdi/instantiated-beans#, Using CDI Beans>>


.Unused Bean Removal in Quarkus
[NOTE]
Quarkus attempts to remove by default all unused beans during the build. However, it can't detect the programmatic lookup performed by the [classname]`QuarkusInstantiator` class in Vaadin. Therefore, when implementing beans that are not referenced directly by the application code, you might need to add the [annotationname]`@Unremovable` annotation to the class. +
[since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.8]##[annotationname]`@VaadinServiceEnabled` annotated beans are marked as unremovable by default.##

== Configure Custom Vaadin Executor

When a Vaadin application starts in a Quarkus environment, the [classname]`QuarkusVaadinServletService` overrides the `createDefaultExecutor()` method to use CDI capabilities for selecting an appropriate [interfacename]`Executor` for executing Vaadin's internal tasks. The selection process follows this order:

1. Look for a custom [interfacename]`Executor` bean qualified with the [annotationname]`@VaadinServiceEnabled` annotation
2. If no custom executor is found, try to use the container's [interfacename]`ManagedExecutor`
3. If neither is available, fall back to Vaadin's <<{articles}/flow/advanced/service-executor#, default executor>> implementation

To avoid ambiguity, the Quarkus extension enforces these rules:

* There can be at most one [interfacename]`Executor` bean annotated with [annotationname]`@VaadinServiceEnabled`
* If multiple [interfacename]`Executor` beans with [annotationname]`@VaadinServiceEnabled` annotation are found, the application deployment will fail with an appropriate error message


You can provide your own task executor to customize how Vaadin executes server-side operations. This can be useful for implementing custom threading models, using specific thread pools, or integrating with other execution frameworks.
To provide a custom executor, define a CDI bean that implements the [interfacename]`Executor` interface and annotate it with [annotationname]`@VaadinServiceEnabled`:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class ExecutorConfiguration {

    @Produces
    @Singleton
    @VaadinServiceEnabled
    public Executor vaadinTaskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolExecutor customExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
            16, // Core pool size
            32, // Maximum pool size
            120, // Keep-alive time
            TimeUnit.SECONDS,
            new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(),
            r -> {
                Thread thread = new Thread(r, "CustomVaadinExecutor-" + r.hashCode());
                thread.setDaemon(true);
                return thread;
            });
        customExecutor.allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true);
        return customExecutor;
    }
}

[[quarkus.vaadin.addons]]
== Vaadin Add-Ons in Quarkus

Any Vaadin add-on used in a Quarkus application should contain a Jandex index. You can generate an index using the `jandex-maven-plugin`. For more information on this, see the Quarkus documentation on https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference#how-to-generate-a-jandex-index[How to Generate a Jandex Index].

If you can't modify the dependency, you can still have Quarkus index it by adding `quarkus.index-dependency` entries to your [filename]`application.properties`:

.[filename]`application.properties`
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.index-dependency.<name>.group-id=
quarkus.index-dependency.<name>.artifact-id=
quarkus.index-dependency.<name>.classifier=(this one is optional)
----

The `<name>` string here is used to link the `group-id`, `artifact-id` and `classifier` entries in one logical block. It should be the same for these three entries, and be any string literal.


== Development Mode

After doing the <<quarkus.setup>>, the Quarkus application can be started in development mode using the `quarkus:dev` goal in Maven:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn quarkus:dev
----

The application is then available at http://localhost:8080/[+localhost:8080+] in the browser.


== Production Mode

The Quarkus base starter already includes the necessary Maven configuration to run the application in production mode. If you have a project not based on the starter, it'll need the configuration described in <<{articles}/flow/production#enabling-the-production-mode, Deploying to Production>>.

When you're ready, run the following commands to start the application:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn package
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----


[[quarkus.vaadin.livereload]]
== Live Reload

Live reload functionality is supported for changes in either Java or frontend files.

When running in development mode (i.e., `quarkus:dev`), changes in Java or frontend files compile after saving. They'll appear in the browser page after it's refreshed. For frontend changes, though, the browser page is reloaded automatically. 

For Java changes, a manual refresh is required. Furthermore, Java hot reload may sometimes break frontend live reload. If this happens, the server needs to be restarted.


== Integrating Vaadin with Existing Quarkus Application

One of the things to consider when integrating Vaadin with an existing Quarkus application is that the application may already have set up routes that may effectively "shadow" the Vaadin UI. A typical scenario for adding Vaadin to an existing Quarkus application is providing some sort of administration dashboard functionality that sits under a sub-root path (e.g., `/admin`). Using the documented way of setting a `@Route` at the view level won't solve the issue:

```java
// This won't solve the issue
@Route("/admin")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {
```

The problem is that, by default, Vaadin's Quarkus extension would spin a `QuarkusVaadinServlet` instance that expects every call to the root (i.e., `/`) of your Quarkus application to go through it. If there is even a single `@Path("/")` annotation anywhere in the application's code, it may effectively "shadow" the access to the servlet.

To solve this problem, you'll need to either remove the `@Path("/")` annotations if possible -- it may not be possible if they already serve the index page of your site -- or create a custom instance of `QuarkusVaadinServlet` that would take place instead of the default one:

```java
@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/admin/*", name = "AdminServlet", asyncSupported = true)
public class AdminServlet extends QuarkusVaadinServlet {
```

Notice how the servlet listens to incoming requests matching the `/admin/*` mapping and no longer the root. In this case, you'll also need to adjust Vaadin's `@Route` annotations, accordingly. For example, `@Route("/admin")` would now turn into `@Route("")`. Otherwise, your view would expect to be called with `/admin/admin`, which is likely not what you want.


[[quarkus.vaadin.limitations]]
== Limitations

The Vaadin Quarkus plugin doesn't support Hilla because Hilla requires the use of Spring. Adding the Quarkus Spring extensions doesn't allow Hilla to work correctly. The extensions don't provide a complete Spring implementation. This is explained in the https://quarkus.io/guides/spring-di#important-technical-note[Important Technical Note] paragraph of the Quarkus Spring DI documentation.


[[quarkus.vaadin.knownissues]]
== Known Issues

Quarkus Bill-of-Materials (BOM) may pin libraries to a version that conflicts with Vaadin. This can result in runtime errors or test failures during development because of changes in method signatures.

For example, a common problem is a conflict with the Java Native Access (JNA) version. That may cause runtime errors such as `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/jna/platform/unix/LibCAPI$size_t$ByReference` or `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'void com.sun.jna.Memory.close()'`, depending on the platform the application is running.

This can be fixed by making sure the Vaadin BOM in the dependency management section of the project's [filename]`pom.xml` file is located immediately above the reference to Quarkus BOM.
