= Creating a Project from a Maven Archetype

:vaadin-version: {moduleMavenVersion:com.vaadin:vaadin}

You can use a https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_an_archetype[Maven archetype] to generate a Vaadin web application with a preconfigured Jetty Maven plugin in it.
Once it is created, you can import it into your IDE.

Most IDEs support creating a project from a Maven archetype.
Please see your IDE and its documentation for instructions.

On the command line, you can generate a project as follows:

[subs="normal"]
----
mvn -B archetype:generate \
-DarchetypeGroupId=com.vaadin \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=vaadin-archetype-application \
-DarchetypeVersion=[replaceable]#LATEST# \
-DgroupId=[replaceable]#org.example# \
-DartifactId=[replaceable]#my-webapp# \
-Dversion=[replaceable]#1.0-SNAPSHOT#
----

The parameters are as follows:

[parameter]#archetypeGroupId#::
The group ID of the archetype is `com.vaadin` for Vaadin archetypes.

[parameter]#archetypeArtifactId#:: The archetype ID.
There is currently one archetype, `vaadin-archetype-application`.

[parameter]#archetypeVersion#::
Version of the archetype to use.
`LATEST` selects the latest version.
For prerelease versions, it should be the exact version number, such as `{vaadin-version}`.

[parameter]#groupId#::
A Maven group ID for your project.
This is normally your organization domain name in reverse order, such as `com.example`.
The group ID is also used as a prefix for the Java package in the sources.
For this reason, it should be Java-compatible; that is, consisting of only alphanumeric characters and the underscore character.

[parameter]#artifactId#::
Identifier of the artifact, that is, your project.
The identifier may contain alphanumeric and underscore characters.
It is appended to the group ID to create the Java package name for the sources.
For example, if the group ID is `com.example` and the artifact ID is `myproject`, the project sources will be placed in the `com.example.myproject` package.

[parameter]#version#::
The initial version number of your application.
The number must follow the Maven version numbering format.

Creating a project can take a while, as Maven fetches all the dependencies.
