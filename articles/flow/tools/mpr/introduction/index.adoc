= Step-by-Step Guide

This document guides you through a series of steps to upgrade a working Vaadin 7 or Vaadin 8 application to Vaadin Flow.

It's easier to get started by changing things inside the existing Vaadin application than starting from a Flow Starter.

The first step is to configure the Maven dependencies and plugins for MPR to work. The settings depend on which Vaadin version you use:

- Application uses <<1-maven-v7#,Vaadin 7 -> >>
- Application uses <<1-maven-v8#,Vaadin 8 -> >>
