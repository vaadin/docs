= Importing Style Sheets

[.lead]
Import style sheets to your application.

== Prerequisites

You should be familiar with <<{articles}/ds/customization/style-scopes#,Style Scopes>>, to know whether you need to import a style sheet to the global scope or to a component scope.

To learn where CSS files should be placed in your project, see <<../advanced/loading-resources#,Loading Resources>>.


== Bundled Style Sheets

Use the [classname]`@CssImport` annotation to import style sheets which are in your application source folder.

Bundled style sheets are included to the application bundle during a <<{articles}/guide/production#,production build>>, together with other client-side resources.

Bundling is recommended for styles that change together with the application logic or component implementations, as the browser can cache them as a single unit of related resources.

[source, Java]
----
// Import a style sheet into the global scope
@CssImport("./styles/shared-styles.css")
public class MyApplication extends Div {
}
----

The `@CssImport` annotation can also be used to import component-specific style sheets.

[source, Java]
----
// Import a style sheet into the local scope of the TextField component
@CssImport(value = "./styles/text-field.css",
           themeFor = "vaadin-text-field")
----


== External Style Sheets

The [classname]`@StyleSheet` annotation can be used to import style sheets from an external URL, or from a URL within your application. The latter type of URLs are prefixed with `context://`, which points to the root of the public resources folder of your application.

External/linked style sheets can be used to import styles without including the contents to the application bundle.
This allows the browser to load and cache the style sheet independently from the rest of the application.

External style sheets need to be accessible from a URL, and need to be placed in the public resource folder in your web application.
They can also come from outside your web application, for example from a different domain or a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

[source, Java]
----
@StyleSheet("context://custom-font.css")
@StyleSheet("https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css")
public class MyApplication extends Div {
}
----

.External CSS can override your styles
[CAUTION]
The CSS rules in external style sheets are not protected from overriding component or view styles.
