= Starting the Application in TypeScript

Client-side bootstrapping allows creating parts of the application UI in TypeScript.
It also allows starting an app without creating a connected server-side <<../introduction/introduction-overview#,`UI`>> instance, which means applications can be stateless.

This is one of the building blocks that enable starting an application and navigating between views when offline, and creating applications that are easy to scale because they do not consume server resources for each user session.

[WARNING]
This feature is experimental and it *will change* before the next Long-Term-Supported Vaadin version.
If you have an idea how to make it more useful for you, please share it on link:https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/new/[GitHub^].

.frontend/index.ts
[source, typescript]
----
import {Router} from '@vaadin/router';
export const router = new Router(document.querySelector('#outlet'));

import {Flow} from '@vaadin/flow-frontend/Flow';
const {serverSideRoutes} = new Flow({
  imports: () => import('../target/frontend/generated-flow-imports')
});

router.setRoutes(serverSideRoutes);
----

For applications where the UI is built in Java and does not include any client-side views the client-side bootstrapping process is transparent.
A default `index.html` / `index.ts` pair is generated during the build, and immediately loads the server-side `UI` when the app starts.
If there is a need to add a client-side view to the application later, it can be done incrementally, with minimal modifications.
See more details on this in the <<default-bootstrap-template-and-entry-point,Default Bootstrap Template and Entry Point>> section below.

[NOTE]
If you are migrating from an earlier version of Vaadin, check the <<../v15-migrationupgrading-from-vaadin14#migrating-from-vaadin-10-14,Migrating from Vaadin 10-14>> section below.


== Starting a Flow App from Client-side Code

When using client-side bootstrapping, Vaadin does not load the Flow client or create a server-side `UI` instance until that is explicitly triggered from the client-side code.
The Flow TypeScript API includes a `flow.serverSideRoutes` property that allows integrating Flow routes with Vaadin Router, by adding them directly into the routes configuration:

[source, typescript]
----
router.setRoutes([
    ...serverSideRoutes
]);
----


With client-side routing you can optimize your application to load the minimal content to be displayed to users at the first load. This might reduce the first-loading time compared to the Vaadin 10-14 bootstrapping method which loads a full Vaadin application on the first request. As a result, the first request loads promptly and that improves the first interaction experience.


== Bootstrap Page Template [[bootstrap-page-template]]

When using client-side bootstrapping, Vaadin servlet uses the `frontend/index.html` file as a template to generate the bootstrap page response. It processes the template and injects the following additional information:

  - `<base href='./relative/to/root'>`: Vaadin calculates the relative path from the current request path to the root path of the application. That is required for relative links in the app view templates to work correctly.

  - Bundled script: Vaadin automatically adds the bundled and optimized script generated from the `frontend/index.ts` file. It uses a pre-configured link:https://webpack.js.org/[Webpack^] instance that's included together with `vaadin-maven-plugin` as a module bundler. Therefore, in the `frontend/index.html` template there is no need to include the `index.ts` (or `index.js`) script manually.

NOTE: The frontend directory can be customized by providing the property `vaadin.frontend.frontend.folder` when running the Maven goals `prepare-frontend`  or `build-frontend` from `vaadin-maven-plugin`.

=== Default Bootstrap Template and Entry Point [[default-bootstrap-template-and-entry-point]]

If the `index.html` or `index.ts` files in the frontend folder are missing, `vaadin-maven-plugin` generates a default corresponding file in the `target` folder. The generated files starts the application so that it uses only server-side routing. You can take control of these files by moving them into the `frontend` folder. By default these files look similar to the following:

.Default `index.html`
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <style>
    body, #outlet {
      height: 100vh;
      width: 100vw;
      margin: 0;
    }
  </style>
  <!-- index.ts is included here automatically (either by the dev server or during the build) -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- vaadin-router in index.ts needs an outlet for displaying the views -->
  <div id="outlet"></div>
</body>
</html>
----

.Default `index.ts` [[default-index-ts]]
[source,typescript]
----
// import Vaadin client-router to handle client-side and server-side navigation
import {Router} from '@vaadin/router';

// import Flow module to enable navigation to Vaadin server-side views
import {Flow} from '@vaadin/flow-frontend/Flow';

const {serverSideRoutes} = new Flow({
  imports: () => import('../target/frontend/generated-flow-imports')
});

const routes = [
  // for client-side, place routes below (more info https://vaadin.com/docs/v15/flow/typescript/creating-routes.html)

  // for server-side, the next magic line sends all unmatched routes:
  ...serverSideRoutes // IMPORTANT: this must be the last entry in the array
];

// Vaadin router needs an outlet in the index.html page to display views
export const router = new Router(document.querySelector('#outlet'));
router.setRoutes(routes);
----

NOTE: The auto-generated bootstrap template works best for server-side applicaitons. In order add client-side views into the app, please follow the  <<quick-start-guide#step-3, Quick Start Guide>>.
