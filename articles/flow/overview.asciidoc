= Flow

Flow is a Java web framework for building modern web apps and websites.
You can create UIs in Java, or use HTML templates to create the UI, and then bind it to any backend using Java.

Features:

* An architecture that lets you concentrate on the UI.
No need to think about client-server communication.
* A set of carefully crafted UI components that focus on both the end-user and developer experience.
* Powerful abstraction layers to build your own reusable UI components with either Java or HTML templates.
* Data binding API to connect UI components to any backend using type-safe Java.
* Router API to create hierarchical page structures for the user to navigate.
