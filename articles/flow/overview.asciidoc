= Flow

Flow is a Java web framework for building modern web apps in Java.
You can create UIs in pure Java, or use HTML templates to create the UI, and then bind it to any backend using Java.

The basic features in Flow are:

* An architecture that lets you concentrate on the UI.
No need to think about client-server communication.

* A set of carefully crafted UI components that focus on both the end-user and developer experience.

* Powerful abstraction layers to build your own reusable UI components with either Java or HTML templates.

* Data binding API to connect UI components to any backend using type-safe Java.

* Router API to create hierarchical page structures for the user to navigate.

For example, you can create a UI in Java as follows:

.`MainView.java`
[source,java]
----
// Create an HTML element
Div layout = new Div();

// Use TextField for standard text input
TextField textField = new TextField("Your name");

// Button click listeners can be defined as lambda expressions
Button button = new Button("Say hello",
          e -> Notification.show("Hello!"));

// Add the web components to the HTML element
layout.add(textField, button);
----

When using the Flow Java API, the components control their JavaScript counterparts in the browser.
You do not need know anything about the HTML or JavaScript that runs under the hood.
