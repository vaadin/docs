// tag::authentication-authorization[]
== Authentication and Authorization

Vaadin lets you choose which authentication and authorization framework you want to use, instead of bundling any specific one.
Vaadin is fully compatible with the most used security solutions in the Java ecosystem, including but not limited to Spring Security, JAAS and Apache Shiro.
The Vaadin-Spring addon has helpers for developers to integrate into the security mechanisms of those respective frameworks.

Since Vaadin is a server-side framework, credential processing always happens on the server, away from any possible attack surface.
Credentials are never transmitted to the client unless explicitly done so by the developer.

Generally, it is recommended that the developer double-checks user identity and access rights for each call from the client.
This can be automated with, for example, Spring Security and view-based authentication using roles.
What typically can't be automated by these frameworks is data-based access rights, such as limiting access to specific entities.

As an example, if the server receives an ID of a User object to be displayed in, for example, a URL request parameter (`{yourapp.com}/users/4/edit`), then the ID in question can be freely changed by an attacker.
The application needs to be aware of this and check if the currently logged-in user has access rights to this entity.
This is something that is common to all UI frameworks, and not specific to Vaadin.

== View-Based Access Control

[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V21 standalone"]
--
--

Since Vaadin 21, it is possible to use a built-in view-based access control mechanism to secure Flow navigation targets.
However, as mentioned in <<Authentication and Authorization,Authentication and Authorization>>, it is not mandatory to use it, so it is not enabled by default.
The view-based access control mechanism uses the `@AnonymousAllowed`, `@PermitAll`, `@RolesAllowed`, and `@DenyAll` annotations on view classes to define the access control rules.
**By default any view without an annotation is secured - it acts like it would have the `@DenyAll` annotation in it.**

See <<{articles}/flow/integrations/spring/view-based-access-control#, View-Based Access Control>> for detailed information about enabling the access control mechanism in Vaadin Flow Spring Boot applications.

To enable and use this mechanism, the following should be added to a Vaadin Flow application (if it does not exist already):

- A login view.
- Logout capability.
- A `VaadinServiceInitListener` that adds `ViewAccessChecker` as the `BeforeEnterListener` of all UIs.
- A Service Provider under `META-INF/services` to load above the custom [classname]#ServiceInitListener# via the Java SPI loading mechanism.

=== Handle User's Login and Logout
There are many ways to handle login and logout, and how to get the authenticated user for a request.
The View-based access control implementation in Vaadin uses [methodname]#getUserPrincipal()# and [methodname]#isUserInRole(String)# in [classname]#HttpServletRequest# to check whether the currently authenticated user has access to the view.
Therefore, you need a way to put the user information into the request.

The example below uses the currently active Vaadin servlet request.
It shows how to:

- Check whether the user is currently authenticated to the application or not.
The request is not available in background threads, so the [methodname]#isAuthenticated()# method shows authentication state only in Vaadin request processing threads, otherwise it would always return `false`.
- Authenticate the user with the given credentials.
The [methodname]#authenticate()# method fails if is called from a background thread.
- Logout the user by invalidating the HTTP session and redirecting to the home page.

.[filename]#SecurityUtils.java#
[source,java]
----
public class SecurityUtils {

    private static final String LOGOUT_SUCCESS_URL = "/";

    public static boolean isAuthenticated() {
        VaadinServletRequest request = VaadinServletRequest.getCurrent();
        return request != null && request.getUserPrincipal() != null;
    }

    public static boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        VaadinServletRequest request = VaadinServletRequest.getCurrent();
        if (request == null) {
            // This is in a background thread and we cannot access the request to
            // log in the user
            return false;
        }
        try {
            request.login(username, password);
            return true;
        } catch (ServletException e) {
            // login exception handle code omitted
            return false;
        }
    }

    public static void logout() {
        VaadinSession.getCurrent().getSession().invalidate();
        UI.getCurrent().getPage().setLocation(LOGOUT_SUCCESS_URL);
    }
}
----

=== Adding Login View
Having a login view is one of the basic requirements of many authentication and authorization mechanisms.
It serves to redirect anonymous users to that page before granting access to view any protected resources.

.[filename]#LoginView.java#
[source,java]
----
@Route("login")
@PageTitle("Login")
public class LoginView extends VerticalLayout implements BeforeEnterObserver,
        ComponentEventListener<AbstractLogin.LoginEvent> {

    private static final String LOGIN_SUCCESS_URL = "/";

    private LoginForm login = new LoginForm();

    public LoginView() {
        addClassName("login-view");
        setSizeFull();

        setJustifyContentMode(JustifyContentMode.CENTER);
        setAlignItems(Alignment.CENTER);

        login.addLoginListener(this);

        add(new H1("Test Application"), login);
    }

    @Override
    public void beforeEnter(BeforeEnterEvent beforeEnterEvent) {
        if (beforeEnterEvent.getLocation()
            .getQueryParameters()
            .getParameters()
            .containsKey("error")) {
            login.setError(true);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onComponentEvent(AbstractLogin.LoginEvent loginEvent) {
        boolean authenticated = SecurityUtils.authenticate(
                loginEvent.getUsername(), loginEvent.getPassword());
        if (authenticated) {
            UI.getCurrent().getPage().setLocation(LOGIN_SUCCESS_URL);
        } else {
            login.setError(true);
        }
    }
}
----

In this example, Vaadin's Login Form component is used for the sake of brevity.
However, feel free to implement your own login view, if you wish.

=== Logout Capability

You typically let the user to log out by using a logout button.
The following example shows a basic implementation of a logout button shown on the header of the main layout:

.[filename]#MainLayout.java#
[source,java]
----
public class MainLayout extends AppLayout {

    public MainLayout() {
        H1 logo = new H1("Vaadin CRM");
        logo.addClassName("logo");
        HorizontalLayout header;
        if (SecurityUtils.isAuthenticated()) {
            Button logout = new Button("Logout", click ->
                    SecurityUtils.logout());
            header = new HorizontalLayout(logo, logout);
        } else {
            header = new HorizontalLayout(logo);
        }

        // Other page components omitted.

        addToNavbar(header);
    }
}
----

=== Adding VaadinServiceInitListener
In order to restrict access to views, a `BeforeEnterListener` must be registered for the `VaadinService`, to initialize and enable the `ViewAccessChecker`:

.[filename]#ViewAccessCheckerInitializer.java#
[source,java]
----
import com.vaadin.flow.server.ServiceInitEvent;
import com.vaadin.flow.server.VaadinServiceInitListener;
import com.vaadin.flow.server.auth.ViewAccessChecker;
import org.vaadin.example.views.login.LoginView;

public class ViewAccessCheckerInitializer implements VaadinServiceInitListener {

    private ViewAccessChecker viewAccessChecker;

    public ViewAccessCheckerInitializer() {
        viewAccessChecker = new ViewAccessChecker(); // <1>
        viewAccessChecker.enable(); // <2>
        viewAccessChecker.setLoginView(LoginView.class); // <3>
    }

    @Override
    public void serviceInit(ServiceInitEvent serviceInitEvent) {
        serviceInitEvent.getSource().addUIInitListener(uiInitEvent -> {
            uiInitEvent.getUI().addBeforeEnterListener(viewAccessChecker); // <4>
        });
    }
}
----

The above code contains some notable components of the view-based access control mechanism:

<1> `ViewAccessChecker`, which is at the core of this access control mechanism, is instantiated.
<2> `ViewAccessChecker` is enabled. Note that it is not enabled by default.
<3> `LoginView` class is set to the `viewAccessChecker` instance. Now it knows where to redirect unauthenticated users.
<4> The `viewAccessChecker` instance is set as the `BeforeEnterListener` in the overridden `serviceInit` method.
Now it is ready to intercept attempts to enter all views.

However, the above class still needs to be loaded, so we recommend following the instructions in the next step.

=== Enable Loading of VaadinServiceInitListener
To enable the Java SPI loading mechanism to load the above `ViewAccessCheckerInitializer` as the `VaadinServiceInitListener`, do the following:

- Under `resources/META-INF/services` directory, create a file named exactly:
+
[text,text]
----
com.vaadin.flow.server.VaadinServiceInitListener
----

- Put the fully qualified name of `ViewAccessCheckerInitializer` into this newly created file.
For example, if the [classname]#ViewAccessCheckerInitializer# class is in the `org.vaadin.example.security` package, the following value should be in the file:
+
.Text value that should be in the `com.vaadin.flow.server.VaadinServiceInitListener` file:
[text,text]
----
org.vaadin.example.security.ViewAccessCheckerInitializer
----

This Service Provider config file triggers the Java SPI loading mechanism to load `ViewAccessCheckerInitializer` during application startup.
More information on this can be found in <<{articles}/flow/advanced/service-init-listener#,VaadinServiceInitListener>>.

=== Access Annotations
Before we see some examples of access annotations, it is worth having a closer look at the annotations, and their meaning when applied to a view:

- [classname]#@AnonymousAllowed# permits anyone to navigate to the view without any authentication or authorization.
- [classname]#@PermitAll# allows any *authenticated* user to navigate to the view.
- [classname]#@RolesAllowed# grants access to users having the roles specified in the annotation value.
- [classname]#@DenyAll# disallows everyone from navigating to the view.
This is the default, which means that, if a view is not annotated at all, the [classname]#@DenyAll# logic is applied.

Some usage examples:

.Example of using [classname]#@AnonymousAllowed# to enable all users to navigate to this view
[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "", layout = MainView.class)
@PageTitle("Public View")
@AnonymousAllowed
public class PublicView extends VerticalLayout {
    // ...
}
----

.Example of using [classname]#@PermitAll# to allow only authenticated users (with any role) to navigate to this view
[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "private", layout = MainView.class)
@PageTitle("Private View")
@PermitAll
public class PrivateView extends VerticalLayout {
    // ...
}
----

.Example of using [classname]#@RolesAllowed# to enable only users with the `ADMIN` role to navigate to this view
[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "admin", layout = MainView.class)
@PageTitle("Admin View")
@RolesAllowed("ROLE_ADMIN") // <- Should match one of the user's roles (case-sensitive)
public class AdminView extends VerticalLayout {
    // ...
}
----

Now, if the application is started by navigating to `http://localhost:8080`, `PublicView` contents should be available without any authentication.
However, by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/private` or `http://localhost:8080/admin`, the user is redirected to the specified `LoginView`.

// TODO: Consider adding more details and snippet code to showcase how the following can be achieved:
// 1. login with some users with different roles
// 2. save the requested URL to redirect to it after a successful login

The following example shows how the security annotations are inherited from the closest parent class that has them.

.Example of inheriting security annotations from parent class
[source,java]
----
@RolesAllowed("ROLE_ADMIN")
public abstract class AbstractAdminView extends VerticalLayout {
    // ...
}

@Route(value = "user-listing", layout = MainView.class)
@PageTitle("User Listing")
public class UserListingView extends AbstractAdminView {
    // ...
}
----

Annotating a child class will override any inherited annotations.
Interfaces are not checked for annotations, but only classes.
By design, the annotations are not read from parent layouts or "parent views", as this would make things unnecessarily complex to determine which security level should be applied.
If multiple annotations are specified on a single view class, the following rules are applied:

- `DenyAll` overrides other annotations
- `AnonymousAllowed` overrides `RolesAllowed` and `PermitAll`
- `RolesAllowed` overrides `PermitAll`

However, we do not recommend specifying more than one of the above access annotations on a view class.
It is confusing and probably has no logical purpose.

== Application State

The server is always aware of your application's state. 
This means that, like client-side applications, the server is aware of what is currently visible on the end user's screen. 
Hence, Vaadin denies actions to components that are not currently visible on the screen, or those that have been disabled on the server.

For instance, if the developer sets a component to be disabled, this effect is set both on the server and the client. On the client, an attacker can circumvent this (attackers have full control over anything in the browser), but the server will block any attempt to interact with the component and a warning is printed to the server logs.

[source,java]
----
Button button = new Button("Click me for effect!");
button.setEnabled(false);
button.addClickListener(e -> {
    // If the Button is disabled, this listener will not run,
    // even if an attacker enables the button client side.
});
----
// tag::data-validation[]
== Data Validation

In a Vaadin application, the data binding API supports data validation on the server, which cannot be by-passed with client-side attacks. 
Vaadin components do support client-side validation to increase the responsiveness of the application, but the developer should be aware that these should be used purely for convenience, since they are easily circumvented in the browser.

As with other web applications, all data coming from the client should always be validated once it reaches the server. 
It is not safe to rely on only client-side validation. 
Vaadin provides a set of pre-created server side validators for this purpose. 
In addition, the developer is free to use any Java API for validating the data, including connecting to external services. 
Vaadin also has a built-in integration with Java's Bean Validation (JSR 303) standard.

Data coming from a data store (such as a database) and inserted as HTML into DOM elements (for example, setting innerHTML for elements or using HTML mode in component captions) should also be escaped. 
Please see the chapter for XSS for more information.

// end::data-validation[]
== Web Services

No public Web Services are necessary in Vaadin applications. 
All communication in Vaadin goes through a single HTTP request handler used for RPC requests using the standard Servlet Java API. 
With Vaadin, you never open up your business logic as web services and thus there are less attack entry points to your Vaadin application.

// tag::ssl-https[]
== SSL and HTTPS

Vaadin always recommend developers to set up secure server endpoints and run all communication exclusively under HTTPS. 
Vaadin works out-of-the-box with HTTPS, and there is nothing for the developer to configure in your application code. 
Please refer to the documentation of your servlet container for details on how to set up HTTPS on your server.
