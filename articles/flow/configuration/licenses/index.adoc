= License Validation & Troubleshooting
:hide-uri-scheme:

Vaadin core includes an extensive set of technologies and components that are free to use.
Vaadin core is available under the terms of the Apache License 2.0, which allows you to use what's included in any project -- even commercially.

You need a commercial license only if you use one of the commercial components (e.g., Vaadin Charts) or one of the tools (e.g., Vaadin TestBench). If a project includes such components or tools, a commercial license is needed for development, and to build a production application.

Vaadin requires a production runtime license only for a Premium subscription which counts <<{articles}/flow/configuration/licenses/daily-active-users#, Daily Active Users>>. Starting in version 24.5, Collaboration Kit is free. Previously, it was priced per end-user (see <<{articles}/tools/collaboration/developing-with-ce#,Collaboration Kit documentation>>).

For other use cases, you don't need a license after deploying an application to production.

== Commercial Trials (Pre‑Trial and 30‑Day Trial)

The Vaadin commercial trial experience lets you evaluate all Premium commercial features — such as Vaadin Copilot, commercial components (e.g., Charts), and acceleration kits — with minimal friction.

- 7‑day Commercial Pre‑Trial (no registration): Start instantly by clicking a button in the development tooling.
- 30‑day Full Commercial Trial (registration required): Extend your evaluation by signing in.

Both trials enable commercial features in development. Production builds during trials are allowed with an opt‑in flag and will display a visible runtime banner.

[NOTE]
The unified onboarding path to trials is through the Dev Tools / Copilot menu (the "}" button) and via automatic splash screens shown when a commercial feature is used without a license.

=== How the Pre‑Trial Works (7 Days, No Registration)

When you use a commercial feature (for example, place a commercial component on a view or trigger Copilot) and no valid license is found, a modal splash screen appears in dev mode. It explains that a subscription or trial is required and offers two choices:

- Try for 7 days (no registration)
- Log in / Sign up (to acquire or extend a license/trial)

What you’ll see on the screen:
- Title: "Start a Trial or Log in" (or "Trial expired" if your previous pre‑trial has just expired)
- List of the commercial product(s) currently used
- Link to the commercial license terms
- Note: "Production builds during the trial will be watermarked" (i.e., bannered)
- Buttons:
- Try for 7 days: Starts the 7‑day pre‑trial immediately.
- Log in / Sign up: Opens your browser to sign in and retrieve a license key or start the 30‑day trial.

Cooldown policy:
- The 7‑day pre‑trial can be started again on the same machine after 30 days.

=== 30‑Day Full Trial (Registration Required)

If you choose Log in / Sign up from the splash screen, or when your pre‑trial has expired, you’ll be guided to authenticate and start a 30‑day trial. This enables all commercial features for 30 days.

- Screen behavior: When a pre‑trial start fails because the pre‑trial has expired, the splash shows guidance to "Extend trial 30 days" (via the login path).
- Cooldown policy: The 30‑day trial can be started again after 90 days per user/account.

=== What Triggers the Splash Screen

- Development mode: The splash appears automatically the first time a commercial feature is used and no local key is found. It lists the component or tool that triggered the check.
- Subsequent events: Status updates (trial started, expired, license download progress) are shown and development UI reloads when a key becomes available.

=== Production Builds While Using a Trial

Production builds do not enable commercial features by default if you don’t have a valid production license. During trials (pre‑trial or 30‑day), you can opt‑in to enable commercial features in production builds by adding a build flag that allows a visible banner/watermark.

- Opt‑in flag: -DcommercialWithBanner
- Behavior:
- With the flag: The app builds successfully and a persistent banner is injected at runtime to indicate that commercial features require a subscription. The banner links to the pricing page.
- Without the flag (and no suitable production license): Building an app that includes commercial features fails and suggests enabling the flag.

Example (Maven):
[source,terminal]
----
mvn -DcommercialWithBanner -Pproduction -DskipTests package
----

Example (Gradle):
[source,terminal]
----
./gradlew -Pvaadin.commercialWithBanner -Pvaadin.productionBuild build
----

About the banner:
- Implemented as a web component (<vaadin-commercial-banner>).
- Fixed at the bottom, with the text: "Commercial features require a subscription, read more" linking to https://vaadin.com/pricing.

=== How This Simplifies Trying Commercial Products

- Zero-friction start: A single click starts the 7‑day pre‑trial — no forms or sign‑up.
- Unified place to manage trials: The Dev Tools/Copilot menu and splash screens guide you through activation, extension to 30 days, and license download.
- Works across products: Copilot, commercial components (like Charts), and acceleration kits can all be evaluated under the same trial.

=== Notes and Limitations

- Older Vaadin versions (V7–V23) keep existing trial flows and are excluded from the unified trial experience.
- Hilla users continue to use the legacy Copilot 3‑day trial.
- During trials, production builds that enable commercial features must include the banner via the -DcommercialWithBanner flag.
- Terms: By activating a trial, you agree to the commercial license terms at https://vaadin.com/commercial-license-and-service-terms.

== Local License Validation

On a local machine, the licenses for commercial components and tools are checked automatically using your Vaadin account. The first time you use a commercial component or tool, you'll be asked to log into `vaadin.com` to validate your license.

Once validated, you can continue developing your project. A license key is created on your machine in the following location:

[.example]
--
[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
%userprofile%\.vaadin\proKey
----

[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="macOS/Linux"></source-info>
~/.vaadin/proKey
----
--

[[offline-license-key]]
=== Offline License Key

If your local development environment is offline and can't reach `vaadin.com`, you'll need to get an offline license key.

Each offline license key is tied to the machine ID, in the form of `mid-xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx`. You'll have to submit that to `https://vaadin.com/myaccount/licenses`, so as to download an offline license key.

Once you've downloaded the [filename]`offlineKey` file -- remove any [filename]`.txt` suffix-- you should place it in your home directory:

[.example]
--
[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
%userprofile%\.vaadin\offlineKey
----

[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="macOS/Linux"></source-info>
~/.vaadin/offlineKey
----
--


==== Machine ID

You can find your machine ID in the logs when you try to use a commercial component or tool offline without an existing license key. You can also find it by running the following commands on your machine:

[.example]
--
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.vaadin:license-checker-machineid:1.8.1
java -jar %userprofile%\.m2\repository\com\vaadin\license-checker-machineid\1.8.1\license-checker-machineid-1.8.1.jar
----

[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="macOS/Linux"></source-info>
mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.vaadin:license-checker-machineid:1.8.1 && java -jar ~/.m2/repository/com/vaadin/license-checker-machineid/1.8.1/license-checker-machineid-1.8.1.jar
----

[[server-license-key]]
== Validation on CI/CD or Build Server

For CI/CD/build servers, you'll need to download a server license key. These can only be used for production builds. You can download such a key (i.e., an [filename]`offlineKey` file) from `https://vaadin.com/myaccount/licenses`.

You should place the [filename]`offlineKey` file in the home directory of the CI server like so:

[.example]
--
[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
%userprofile%\.vaadin\offlineKey
----

[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="macOS/Linux"></source-info>
~/.vaadin/offlineKey
----
--

You can also give the license key by using the `vaadin.offlineKey` system property or the `VAADIN_OFFLINE_KEY` environment variable. Copy the license key string value from the [filename]`offlineKey` file.

[.example]
--
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="System property"></source-info>
mvn -Dvaadin.offlineKey=[contents of offlineKey file here] ...
----

[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="Environment variable"></source-info>
VAADIN_OFFLINE_KEY=[contents of offlineKey file here] mvn ...
----
--
