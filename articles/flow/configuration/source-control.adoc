= Source Control

In addition to the standard directory layout of typical Java applications, Vaadin projects also include various files and folders related to the frontend tooling. A typical Vaadin application has a directory layout with something like the following content:

----
node_modules/                    <1>
src/
└── main                         <2>
    └── frontend                 <3>
        └── generated/
        └── themes/              <4>
            └── my-theme         <5>
                └── styles.css   <6>
        └── index.html           <7>
    └── java
    └── resources
└── test/                        <8>
target/
package.json                     <9>
package-lock.json                <10>
pom.xml                          <11>
vite.config.ts                   <12>
vite.generated.ts                <13>
tsconfig.json                    <14>
types.d.ts                       <15>
----
<1> A folder that caches the frontend modules upon which the project depends.
<2> Application sources. This folder is auto-generated based on the contents of [filename]`package.json` and [filename]`package-lock.json`.
<3> Frontend resources -- including CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript files -- are placed in this folder.
<4> This folder includes custom themes.
<5> Each theme is in its own sub-folder. The name of this folder is provided as a parameter to the [annotationname]`@Theme` annotation to apply the theme to the application.
<6> [filename]`styles.css` is the theme's master style sheet that's loaded automatically when the theme is applied.
<7> [filename]`index.html` is an auto-generated file that defines the outermost structure of the application.
<8> Test sources.
<9> [filename]`package.json` defines the version ranges of the frontend dependencies.
<10> [filename]`package-lock.json` defines the exact versions of the frontend dependencies used in this project.
<11> Project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.
<12> Can optionally be used to customize Vite configuration.
<13> An auto-generated file containing the Vite configuration needed for all applications.
<14> An auto-generated file that defines the configuration for compiling TypeScript code in the project, when needed.
<15> An auto-generated file that defines the TypeScript type definitions used in the project.

.Project Content May Vary
[NOTE]
====
The directory layout shown here may vary depending on the project's configuration.
For example, a project using `pnpm` instead of `npm` has a [filename]`pnpm-lock.yaml` file instead of [filename]`package-lock.json`.
====

The following [filename]`.gitignore` file lists the files and folders that should be excluded from a typical Vaadin project.
