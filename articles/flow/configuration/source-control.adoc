= Source Control

In addition to the standard directory layout of typical Java applications, Vaadin projects also include various files and folders related to the frontend tooling. A typical Vaadin application has a directory layout with something like the following content:

----
node_modules/                    <1>
src/
├── main/                        <2>
│   ├── bundles/                 <3>
│   │   ├── dev.bundle           <4>
│   │   └── prod.bundle          <5>
│   ├── frontend/                <6>
│   │   ├── generated/
│   │   └── index.html           <7>
│   ├── java/
│   └── resources/
│       └── META-INF/
│           └── resources/       <8>
└── test/                        <9>
target/
package.json                     <10>
package-lock.json                <11>
pom.xml                          <12>
tsconfig.json                    <13>
types.d.ts                       <14>
vite.config.ts                   <15>
vite.generated.ts                <16>
----
<1> A folder that caches the frontend modules upon which the project depends. This folder is auto-generated based on the contents of [filename]`package.json` and [filename]`package-lock.json`. This folder should not be added to source control.
<2> Application sources.
<3> Automatically generated folder containing the pre-compiled frontend files/resources for your project. `.bundle` files should be added to Version Control System and committed, so that other developers do not need to download and compile frontend files again.
<4> Compressed archive containing development time frontend files/resources.
<5> Compressed archive containing production time frontend files/resources.
<6> Frontend resources, like TypeScript and JavaScript files, are placed in this folder.
<7> [filename]`index.html` is an initially auto-generated file that defines the outermost structure of the application. This file can be added to source control, and should be if customized. For customization of index.html see <<../advanced/modifying-the-bootstrap-page#modifying-the-application-shell, Modifying the Application Shell>>.
<8> Static web resources such as images and stylesheets are placed in this folder.
<9> Test sources.
<10> [filename]`package.json` defines the version ranges of the frontend dependencies.
<11> [filename]`package-lock.json` defines the exact versions of the frontend dependencies used in this project.
<12> Project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.
<13> An auto-generated file that defines the configuration for compiling TypeScript code in the project, when needed.
<14> An auto-generated file that defines the TypeScript type definitions used in the project.
<15> Can optionally be used to customize Vite configuration.
<16> An auto-generated file containing the Vite configuration needed for all applications.

.Project Content May Vary
[NOTE]
====
The directory layout shown here may vary depending on the project's configuration.
For example, a project using `pnpm` instead of `npm` has a [filename]`pnpm-lock.yaml` file instead of [filename]`package-lock.json`.
====

The following files and folders should be added to source control:

* <2> [filename]`src/main/` - Application sources
* <3> <4> <5> [filename]`bundles/` - Pre-compiled frontend bundles
* <6> [filename]`frontend/` - Frontend resources (excluding `generated/`)
* <7> [filename]`index.html` - Can be committed if generated, should be if customized
* <8> [filename]`META-INF/resources/` - Static web resources
* <9> [filename]`src/test/` - Test sources
* <10> [filename]`package.json` - If exists
* <11> [filename]`package-lock.json` - If exists
* <12> [filename]`pom.xml` - Maven project configuration
* <13> [filename]`tsconfig.json` - Can be committed if generated, should be if customized
* <14> [filename]`types.d.ts` - Can be committed if generated, should be if customized
* <15> [filename]`vite.config.ts` - Can be committed if generated, should be if customized

The following should not be added to source control:

* <1> [filename]`node_modules/` - Auto-generated from package files
* <16> [filename]`vite.generated.ts` - Auto-generated by Vaadin

The following [filename]`.gitignore` file lists the files and folders that should be excluded from a typical Vaadin project.
