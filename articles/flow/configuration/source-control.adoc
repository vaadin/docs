= Source Control

In addition to the standard directory layout of typical Java applications, Vaadin projects also include a number of files and folders related to the frontend tooling.
A typical Vaadin application has a directory layout with something like the following content:

----
frontend              <1>
└── generated/
└── themes/           <2>
└── index.html
node_modules/         <3>              
src/
└── main              <4>
    └── java 
    └── resources
└── test/             <5>
target/
package.json          <6>
package-lock.json     <7>
pom.xml               <8>
webpack.config.js     <9>
webpack.generated.js  <10>
tsconfig.json         <11>
types.d.ts
----
<1> Frontend resources, including CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript files are placed under this folder.
<2> This folder includes custom themes.
<3> A folder that caches the frontend modules that the project depends upon.
This folder is auto-generated based on the contents of [filename]#package.json# and [filename]#package-lock.json#.
<4> Application sources.
<5> Test sources.
<6> Holds the metadata related to the project's frontend configuration and dependencies.
<7> Locks the frontend dependencies and their sub-dependencies.
<8> Project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.
<9> Can optionally be used to customize webpack configuration.
<10> An auto-generated file holding Flow's default webpack configuration.
<11> An auto-generated file used to compile the TypeScript code in the project if Lit templates are used.

.Project content may vary
[NOTE]
====
The aforementioned directory layout may vary depending on the project's configuration.
For example, a project using `pnpm` instead of `npm` will have a [filename]#pnpm-lock.yaml# file instead of [filename]#package-lock.json#.
====

The following [filename]#.gitignore# file lists the files and folders that should be excluded from a typical Vaadin project.
