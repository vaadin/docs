= Live Reload with JRebel

https://www.jrebel.com/products/jrebel[JRebel] is a commercial, developer productivity tool for automatic, real-time update of Java code in the running application. Vaadin detects the JRebel Agent and automatically reloads the application in the browser after the Java changes have been hotpatched.


== Basic Set-Up

First, set up and activate JRebel in your IDE by following the _Quick Start_ guides available at https://www.jrebel.com/products/jrebel/learn. Use at least the `2020.2.1` version, which contains built-in live reload integration.

Then run or debug your Vaadin application using the JRebel Agent. Navigate to your Vaadin application in the browser, make and save some changes, and you'll see that the browser reloads automatically.


== Additional Configuration

When using the Jetty Maven plugin together with JRebel, ensure that automatic restart is disabled by omitting or setting `<scanIntervalSeconds>` to a value of `0` or less.


== Startup Delays with JRebel

To reduce the startup time when using JRebel in debug mode in IntelliJ IDE, disable the Reactive Debugger.

To do this, navigate to menu:File[Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Reactive Streams].  Once there, uncheck the "Enable Reactor Debug mode" checkbox.


== Current Limitations

Since the server doesn't restart, modifications to startup listeners and code that connect frontend and backend components (e.g., adding a new [classname]`LitTemplate` class) aren't reflected. However, modifications to routes are picked up.

With <<{articles}/flow/advanced/preserving-state-on-refresh#,`@PreserveOnRefresh`>>, view instances are reused when reloaded in the browser. Hence, hotpatched changes to the view constructor aren't reflected until the view is opened in another browser window or tab.
