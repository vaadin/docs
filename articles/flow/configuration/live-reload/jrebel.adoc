= Live Reload with JRebel

https://www.jrebel.com/products/jrebel[JRebel] is a commercial developer productivity tool for automatic, real-time update of Java code in the running application. Vaadin detects the JRebel Agent and automatically reloads the application in the browser after the Java changes have been hotpatched.

== Step-by-Step Guide

- Set up and activate JRebel in your IDE by following the _Quick Start_ guides available at https://www.jrebel.com/products/jrebel/learn.
Use at least the `2020.2.1` version, which contains built-in live reload integration.
- Run or debug your Vaadin application using the JRebel Agent.
- Navigate to your Vaadin application on the browser, make and save some changes, and the browser reloads automatically.

== Additional Configuration

When using the Jetty Maven plugin together with JRebel, ensure that automatic restart is disabled (omit or set `<scanIntervalSeconds>` to a value of `0` or less).

== Current Limitations

Since the server doesn't restart, modifications to startup listeners and code that connects frontend and backend components, such as adding a new [classname]`LitTemplate` class, aren't reflected. However, modifications to routes are picked up.

With <<{articles}/flow/advanced/preserving-state-on-refresh#,`@PreserveOnRefresh`>>, view instances are reused when reloaded in the browser; hence, hotpatched changes to the view constructor aren't reflected until the view is opened in another browser window or tab.
