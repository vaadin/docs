= Feature Flags

Feature Flags allow you to enable and test experimental features. You can also use it to switch temporarily back to legacy and deprecated behavior. This can allow more time to modify applications to stop using them before removing them.

The following list contains all of the experimental and legacy features. They're also listed in the [classname]`com.vaadin.experimental.FeatureFlags` (https://vaadin.com/api/platform/{moduleMavenVersion:com.vaadin:vaadin}/com/vaadin/experimental/FeatureFlags.html[Javadoc]) class.


== Experimental Features

// Prevent names from wrapping

  word-break: initial !important;
}
</style>
++++

=== Flow Feature Flags

`accessibleDisabledButtons`::
Make disabled components focusable and hoverable.

`collaborationEngineBackend`::
Collaboration Kit backend for clustering support

`copilotExperimentalFeatures`::
Experimental Vaadin Copilot features.

`flowFullstackSignals`::
Enables Flow Full-stack Signals for use.

=== Flow Components Feature Flags

`defaultAutoResponsiveFormLayout`::
Form Layout auto-responsive mode enabled by default

`layoutComponentImprovements`::
HorizontalLayout and VerticalLayout improvements

`masterDetailLayoutComponent`::
A component for building UIs with a horizontally or vertically split pair consisting of a master area and a detail area that can responsively switch to an overlay.

=== Hilla Feature Flags

`fullstackSignals`::
Enable Hilla Full-stack Signals

== Managing Feature Flags

Feature flags can be managed in different ways: by using Vaadin Copilot; by editing the feature flags properties file; or by setting Java system properties. Each of these methods is described in the sub-sections that follow. As you read, keep in mind that system properties always have the highest priority. Since they're not written into the feature flags properties file, they're valid only for a single execution.


=== Vaadin Copilot

It's easy to manage feature flags using Vaadin Copilot. When running your browser in development mode, click the Vaadin Copilot activation button in your application. It's located at bottom right corner.

Next, open the [guilabel]*Feature Flags* panel in right drawer, and then click the toggle buttons to enable or disable features.

When finished, restart the application for your changes to take effect.


=== Editing the Properties File

As mentioned, you can also manage feature flags by editing the properties file. To do so by this method, edit the [filename]`src/main/resources/vaadin-featureflags.properties` file in your application folder -- or create the file if it doesn't already exist.

When you have that file open, add a line for each feature in the format of `com.vaadin.experimental.<FEATURE_NAME>=true`. Here's an example of how this might look:

.`vaadin-featureflags.properties`
[source,properties]
----
com.vaadin.experimental.masterDetailLayoutComponent=true
----

To disable a feature, remove the corresponding line or set its value to `false`.

When you're finished enabling or disabling feature flags, save the properties file and restart the application.


=== Setting Java System Properties

The last method for managing feature flags is to set the Java system properties. From the command-line, use the IDE launch configuration or a tool configuration -- such as, Spring Boot Maven plugin -- to set a system property for each feature flag to be enabled or disabled.

The property name should be in the format, `vaadin.<FEATURE_NAME>`, like so:

[source,terminal]
-Dvaadin.masterDetailLayoutComponent=true

To temporarily disable a feature, set its property value to `false`.
