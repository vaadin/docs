= Vaadin Development Tools

Boost productivity with the Vaadin Development Tools, such as Component Locator, that are available when running applications in development mode.

Current and future functionality of Vaadin Development Tools may offer developers ways to alter the application configuration or even application code. Therefore, it may not be desirable to enable access to Development Tools for everyone -- even when running an application in development mode.

By default, Development Tools can be accessed only from loopback addresses. To configure hosts for Development Tools access, please see `devmode.hostsAllowed` <</flow/configuration/properties/#properties,configuration property>>.
