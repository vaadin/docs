= Including Style Sheets

For styling the application you typically need to include a style sheet. There
are two ways to do this.

[source,java]
----
@StyleSheet("styles.css") // Relative to Servlet URL
@StyleSheet("http://www.example.com/example.css") // Loaded from external location
public class MainLayout extends Component {
  // implementation omitted
}
----

The above snippet uses the `@StyleSheet` annotation on a component. The value of
the annotation is a URL to load the style sheet from. The style sheet is loaded
when the component is shown for the first time in the browser. You can use the
annotation multiple times on the same component.

Another way of adding a style sheet is using the `addStyleSheet(String url)`
method from the `Page` class. It does exactly the same as the `@StyleSheet`
annotation.

[source,java]
----
  public MainLayout(){
      // Loaded from "/root.css" regardless of how your application is deployed
      UI.getCurrent().getPage().addStyleSheet("/root.css");
  }
}
----

You can place style sheets and other static resources in any folder inside your WAR file except for `/VAADIN` which is reserved for framework internal use.
`VaadinServlet` handles static resource requests if you have mapped it to `/*` .
Otherwise, the servlet container will take care of static resource requests.

By using relative URLs you are not dependent on whether the application is deployed in the root context (e.g.  `http://mysite.com/`) or in a sub context (e.g. `http://mysite.com/myapp/`).
Relative URLs are resolved using the page base URI, which is always set to match the servlet URL.

[TIP]
====
If you are using a servlet path for the servlet, e.g. `http://mysite.com/myapp/myservlet/` then you will need to take the servlet path into account when including resources.
This is needed because the base URI is `http://mysite.com/myapp/myservlet/` but static resources are deployed in `http://mysite.com/myapp/`.

You can use the special protocol `context://` with e.g. `Page.addStyleSheet` to ensure a URL relative to the context path but this is only supported when including resources.

When you configure an element, e.g setting the `src` attribute for an `<img>`, you cannot use the `context://` protocol. Your options are then:

* Cancel out the servlet path, e.g. `../images/logo.png`.
* Use an absolute URL, e.g. `/myapp/images/logo.png`
* Deploy your static resources in a directory matching the servlet path, e.g. `/myservlet/`.
====

You should be careful with the global styles which you include using `@StyleSheet` annotation or 
the `addStyleSheet` method. Such styles may leak into web components if a browser 
doesn't have built-in web components support. A web component (see <<../web-components/integrating-a-web-component.asciidoc,Integrating a Web Component>>) normally uses its own styles defined for it and those styles are scoped to the web component.
Global styles don't influence on the web component anyhow as well. 
But this is true only if there is native web components browser support.

[NOTE]

See `Browser support` section https://www.webcomponents.org/[here] for full list 
of browsers which support web components natively and which requires polyfills.   

But if an user uses browser without this native support, then the missing functionality
is polyfilled, and a web component in such browsers is not anymore a scoped unit
but a regular part of the DOM tree. In this case, global styles work for it in the same
way as for any other HTML element.

To be able to prevent leaking global styles into the local DOM of web components you
should use `<custom-style>`:
* Add an import for Polymer `custom-style.html` e.g. `<link rel="import" href="bower_components/polymer/lib/elements/custom-style.html">`. 
* Add `<custom-style>`  declaration including the CSS you want to add into the `<head>` element (see below an example).

[source,html]
----
<custom-style>
  <style>
    html {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</custom-style>
----

You may do this via `@HtmlImport` annotation if you put the content together in one file and import it:

[source,html]
----
<link rel="import" href="bower_components/polymer/lib/elements/custom-style.html">

<custom-style>
  <style>
    html {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</custom-style>
----

then use `@HtmlImport("shared-styles.html")` if the file name `shared-styles.html` 
has the above content.

See https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/api/elements/Polymer.CustomStyle for more details.
