= Component Visibility

Invisible components are no longer displayed in the UI, nor do they receive updates from the client side. You make a component invisible by calling [methodname]`Component.setVisible(false)`. Transmission of server-side updates resumes when you make the component visible again.

*Example*: Making a component invisible, and visible again:

[source,java]
----
Span label = new Span("My label");
label.setVisible(false);
// this isn't transmitted to the client side
label.setText("Changed my label");

Button makeVisible = new Button("Make visible", evt -> {
    // makes the label visible - only now is the
    // "Changed my label" text transmitted
    label.setVisible(true);
});
----

If you make a container with child components invisible (e.g., a `Div` or `Vertical/HorizontalLayout`), the child components are also made invisible. No server-side updates are sent to them, and no client updates are received from them. When the container becomes visible again, updates to the children also resume.


== Hiding before Rendering

If you make a component invisible before it's rendered for the first time, the corresponding element in the DOM won't be created. However, the component still exists on the server-side. When you make the component visible again, the corresponding DOM element is created.

*Example*: Making a component invisible before it's rendered:

[source,java]
----
Span label = new Span("My label");
label.setVisible(false);

Div container = new Div();
// the label isn't transmitted to the client side.
// The corresponding element is created in the
// DOM only when it becomes visible.
container.add(label);

// prints 1 - the server-side structure is preserved
// regardless of whether the component is visible or not
System.out.println("Number of children: "
        + container.getChildren().collect(
                Collectors.counting()));
----


== Hiding after Rendering

If you make an already rendered component invisible, the corresponding element is not removed from the DOM. Instead, it is marked with the `hidden` attribute. Furthermore, the element won't receive any updates from the server. Likewise, the server will ignore any RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) made from the element.
