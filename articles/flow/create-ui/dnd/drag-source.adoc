= Creating a Drag Source

With the [classname]`DragSource` class, you can make any component draggable by the user, and configure the drag operation. By default, the entire component is made draggable, instead of a small part of it. The [classname]`DragSource` class is a configuration object for the dragged item and contains static methods for configuring the given component instance.

[source,java]
----
Div box1 = new Div();
Div box2 = new Div();

// Make box 1 draggable and store reference to the configuration object
DragSource<Div> box1DragSource = DragSource.create(box1);

// Access box 2 drag related configuration object without making it draggable
DragSource<Div> box2DragSource = DragSource.configure(box2);

// Make box 2 draggable
box2DragSource.setDraggable(true);

add(box1, box2);
----

The [classname]`DragSource` configuration object doesn't itself store any data, as it's a convenience proxy that facilitates making a component draggable. Creating a new [classname]`DragSource` instance of a component doesn't reset any previous configuration, but any changes override the previous configuration.

When a component is set draggable on the server side, the `draggable` attribute is assigned to its topmost element on the browser, making it draggable. When the user starts to drag the component, the root element of the component gets the `v-dragged` class name in the browser. This can be used to highlight the dragged component to the user.

[source,css]
----
.v-dragged {
    outline: 1px dotted hotpink;
    opacity: 0.5;
}
----


== Exposing Drag Source API to a Component

As the [interfacename]`DragSource` is an interface, it can also be used as a "mix-in interface", which gives an easy way to add its API to your custom component. This useful when you want to reuse the component in many places for drag operations.

[source,java]
----
public class CardComponent extends Div implements DragSource<CardComponent>, HasStyle {
    public CardComponent() {
        // all cards are draggable by default
        setDraggable(true);
    }
    // all DragSource methods have default implementations
}
----


[drag.data]
== Assigning Server-Side Data to Drag Source

It's possible to set any Java object as the server-side drag data for the drag
source. This data is provided on the [classname]`DropEvent` when the drop occurs on a valid drop target, if it's inside the same UI (browser window / tab) as the drag source component.

[source,java]
----
// continuing from the previous example, CardComponent implements DragSource
CardComponent card1 = new CardComponent();
CardComponent card2 = new CardComponent();

card1.setDragData("Queen of Hearts");
card2.setDragData(new Card(11, Land.Spade)); // the data can be any object
----

The data isn't sent to the browser, as it's stored in the component instance as server-side-only data.

It isn't possible to configure the client-side drag data, the `dataTransfer` object, from the server side.


== Drag Start & End Events

The [interfacename]`DragSource` provides a way to react when the user starts and stops dragging a component. The [classname]`DragStartEvent` is fired when the drag starts in the browser, which means that you can't cancel the drag. You should avoid doing any heavy synchronous processing there, since this blocks the user from dragging the component further in the browser. This has a negative effect on the UX.

[source,java]
----
// Continuing from the previous example with CardComponent
card1.addDragStartListener(event -> {
    // Highlight suitable drop targets in the UI
    getVisibleCards().forEach(target -> {
        Card targetCard = target.getCard();
        if (targetCard.getLand() == ((Card) card1.getDragData()).getLand()
                && target != card1) {
            target.addClassName("possible-drop-zone");
        }
    })
});
----

When the user stops dragging the component by either dropping it or by canceling the drag with, for example, the escape key, the [classname]`DragEndEvent` is fired. The [methodname]`isSuccessful()` method returns `true` if the drop occurred on a drop target that accepted the drop, but only for Chrome and Firefox (read the note after the sample).

[source,java]
----
card1.addDragEndListener(event -> {
    getVisibleCards().forEach(target -> target.removeClassName("possible-drop-zone"));
    // NOTE: The following is always FALSE for Edge and Safari !!!
    if (event.isSuccessful()) {
        // Better to put logic for successful drop into DropEvent for the
        // DropTarget because of the above
    }
});
----

.Handling Drag End in Edge & Safari
[NOTE]
Edge and Safari don't report whether the drop occurred successfully or not in the [classname]`DragEnd` event. You need to take this into account if your users are using any of these browsers, and do any logic in the [classname]`DropEvent` handler of the [classname]`DropTarget` instead. For Chrome and Firefox, it works correctly.


=== Effect Allowed & Drop Effect

It's possible to customize the `effectAllowed` for the drag source. This has an effect on what the browser visually presents to the user and should match what's set in the drop target as the `dropEffect`. The [classname]`DragEndEvent` reports the `dropEffect` for the drop event.

The value is determined in priority order by:

- the desired action `dropEffect` set by the drop target;
- the `effectAllowed` set for the drag source;
- the modifier keys the user presses and holds when dropping.

When the drop effect is `MOVE`, you should move / remove the drag source component from its original location. When the drop effect is `NONE`, the drop didn't occur and [methodname]`dropEvent.isSuccessful()` returns `false`.


=== Customizing the Draggable Element

You can customize the element that is made draggable by overriding the [methodname]`getDraggableElement()` method in the [interfacename]`DragSource` interface.
This is useful if it isn't the whole component that's to be draggable, but only a part of it.

[source,java]
----
/* NOTE: RouteItem is a made up custom component, not a core Vaadin component. */
public class DraggableRouteItem extends RouteItem implements DragSource<RouteItem> {
    private Icon dragHandle = VaadinIcon.MENU.create();

    public DraggableRouteItem(String destination) {
        super(destination);
        add(dragHandle);
    }

    // Instead of allowing the whole item to be draggable, only allow dragging
    // from the icon.
    @Override
    public Element getDraggableElement() {
        return dragHandle.getElement();
    }
}
----

Changing the draggable element also changes the drag image that the browser shows under the cursor.


=== [since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.6]#Drag-Image#

With the [interfacename]`DragSource` interface's [methodname]`setDragImage` methods, it's possible to customize a drag-image that the browser shows under the cursor when dragging a component.

<<../../application/resources#the-image-component, [classname]`Image`>> is applied in the next drag start event in the browser. The [classname]`Image` component is fully supported as a drag image. Other components can be used as well, but the support may vary between browsers. If a given component is a visible element in the viewport, the browser can show it as a drag image.

[source,java]
----
// continuing from the previous example
CardComponent card = new CardComponent();

card.setDragImage(new Image("/cards/ace_of_spades.png", "Ace of Spades"));
----

The [classname]`Image` component supports <<../../advanced/dynamic-content#using-streamresource, StreamResource>> to generate the image, dynamically.

Any optional coordinates define the offset of the pointer location from the top left corner of the image. The following example sets the x offset to 20 pixels and the y offset to 0 pixels:

[source,java]
----
card.setDragImage(new Image("/cards/queen_of_hearts.png", "Queen of Hearts"), 20, 0)
----
