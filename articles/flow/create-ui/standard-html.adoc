Standard HTML components have an API that allows you to set most typical properties and attributes.
You can also use the Element API to set any property or attribute, if the component API doesn't have an appropriate method.

Components that can contain other components implement the [interfacename]`HtmlContainer` interface to create a hierarchical structure.
The Element API allows you to create any standard HTML element using the [classname]`Element` constructor.
The [classname]`ElementFactory` class contains factory methods for many standard HTML elements.

== Html Component
The `Html` class in Vaadin Flow allows developers to encapsulate and manage raw HTML fragments in server-side Java applications.
This component is particularly useful when you have an HTML snippet (either as a string or loaded from a file) that you want to insert
directly into your application's layout or routes. The `Html` class ensures that the HTML fragment is treated as a single unit
with exactly one root element, which can be accessed and managed through the server-side code.

===  Important Considerations:

- Developers are responsible for sanitizing the HTML content before passing it to the Html component. Failure to do so may lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, as the raw HTML is sent directly to the client.
- Once `Html` object is created, the encapsulated HTML fragment cannot be modified. To change the content, a new `Html` instance must be created.
- The `Html` component does not expand the HTML into a server-side DOM tree. This means that while the root element can be accessed via `getElement()`, and the inner content via `getInnerHtml()`, you cannot traverse or manipulate the DOM structure on the server side.
- The HTML fragment must have exactly one root element. If the fragment contains multiple root elements, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- The Html component does not support SVG elements as a root node. For SVG content, the Svg component should be used instead.
