= Creating UI in Vaadin Applications

The Vaadin Design System includes a set of <<{articles}/components#, components>> that you can use to build your UI. The components have a server-side Java API in addition to the TypeScript API for client-side development.

xref:{articles}/components#[Browse components, role="button primary water"]

You use a component by first creating it and then adding it to a containing layout.

For example, to add a <<{articles}/components/button#, Button component>>, create the object and add it to a layout.
