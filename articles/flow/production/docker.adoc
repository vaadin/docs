= Deploying Using Docker

A https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/[Docker container] is a standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: Code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.
Building a Docker image requires creating a [filename]`Dockerfile` which is a text document containing all the commands for assembling and running the image.

== Creating a Dockerfile for New Vaadin Applications

For a new Vaadin application, you can generate a [filename]`Dockerfile` by selecting the [guilabel]*Docker config* option in https://start.vaadin.com in the [guilabel]*Settings* tab.
This approach makes building and running your container as simple as running the following commands:

. Run the following command to make a production build of the Vaadin application:
+
[source,terminal]
----
mvn clean package -Pproduction
----

. Run the following command to build your container:
+
[source,terminal]
----
docker build . -t myapp:latest
----
[NOTE]
The command assumes your project name is `myapp`; replace `myapp` with the name of your project if it's not.
+

. run the following command to run your container on localhost:
+
[source,terminal]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest
----

.Docker Desktop or Docker Server is required
[NOTE]
You need to install https://docs.docker.com/desktop/[Docker Desktop] or https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Server] on your machine before you can run the above commands.

== Adding a Dockerfile to Existing Vaadin Applications

The following example shows a suitable Dockerfile for Spring Boot-based Vaadin applications. You get a similar file when you download a project from https://start.vaadin.com.

.`Dockerfile`
[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
COPY target/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
----

Once you have a [filename]`Dockerfile` in the project directory, you can build and run your container using the `docker build` and `docker run` commands shown earlier.

You can find more information on [filename]`Dockerfile` and the instructions that are available for it at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/.
