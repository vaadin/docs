= Deploying a Vaadin Application to Google Cloud

This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Vaadin application to Google App Engine.
Google Cloud has free-trial and free-tier offerings that you can read more about on the link:https://cloud.google.com/free/[Google Cloud website].

.Google Cloud account required
[NOTE]
To complete this tutorial, you need to sign up for a Google Cloud account at https://cloud.google.com/.
Your Google Cloud account should also have the billing enabled.

== Step 1: Install and Set Up Google Cloud SDK

To begin, download and install the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[Google Cloud SDK].

After it's installed, run the following command from a terminal window to add App Engine support for Java to the SDK.

[source,terminal]
----
gcloud components install app-engine-java
----

== Step 2: Download a Starter App

Download a minimal Vaadin project and unpack the downloaded zip into a folder on your computer.

link:https://start.vaadin.com/dl[Download project]

[WARNING]
Due to issue https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/14164[14164], you need to disable the [annotationname]`@PWA` annotation found on the [classname]`Application` class.

== Step 3: Initialize a Google Cloud Project

Open the project directory from a terminal window, and enter the following command to initialize a Google Cloud project:

[source,terminal]
----
gcloud init
----

If this is your first time running Google SDK, you're asked to authenticate your account.
When prompted to log in, enter *'Y'* and allow the SDK to control your account in the opened browser window.

After authentication, you're prompted to select a configuration.
Enter '1' to select the default configuration, as in the following snippet:

[source]
----
Settings from your current configuration [default] are:
accessibility:
  screen_reader: 'False'
core:
  account: john.doe@gmail.com
  disable_usage_reporting: 'True'

Pick configuration to use:
 [1] Re-initialize this configuration [default] with new settings
 [2] Create a new configuration
Please enter your numeric choice:  1
----

== Step 4: Create an App Engine Instance

From a terminal window, in the project root directory, create a Google App Engine instance using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
gcloud app create
----

You're then be asked to select a region.
You may want to choose the region that's geographically closest to your users.

== Step 5: Set Up the App Engine Plugin for Maven

Add the App Engine Maven plugin to your project's [filename]`pom.xml` file.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>appengine-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.4.3</version>
    <configuration>
        <projectId>GCLOUD_CONFIG</projectId>
        <version>GCLOUD_CONFIG</version>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You need to set the `projectId` and `version` properties for the plugin to work.
The value `GCLOUD_CONFIG` tells the Google Cloud CLI tools to use the `projectId` configured in <<Step 4: Create an App Engine Instance, step 4>>.
Also, make sure to use the latest version of the `appengine-maven-plugin`, which you can find at this link:https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.google.cloud.tools/appengine-maven-plugin[link].

== Step 6: Create the app.yaml File

Next, you need to create an [filename]`app.yaml` file.

[loweralpha]
. Create a directory called `appengine` under `src/main`.
. Create a file called [filename]`app.yaml` under `src/main/appengine`.
This file should have the following content.
+
.app.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
runtime: java11
----
You should change the java runtime version number (`java11`) in the `yaml` file to match the value of the `<java.version>` property in your [filename]`pom.xml` file.

== Step 7: Enable Cloud Build

You also need to enable Cloud Build.

[loweralpha]
. Navigate to `https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=PROJECT_NAME`, replacing *PROJECT_NAME* with your project name found at https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager[Google Cloud Resource Manager].
. Click *Enable*.

== Step 8: Deploy to Google App Engine

Finally, you can build and deploy using a single command as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn package appengine:deploy -Pproduction
----

When the deployment has finished, the application URL is displayed in the logs.

== Common Problems

=== Ensure Google Cloud Billing is Enabled

If the deployment fails with an error similar to `ERROR: (gcloud.app.deploy) Error Response: [7] Access Not Configured.`, then ensure that your Google Cloud account has billing enabled.
After it's enabled, try to deploy again.

=== Memory Limit

If you notice log messages similar to `Exceeded soft memory limit of 256 MB with X MB`, this means your instance has ran out of RAM. You should consider https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java-gen2/config/appref[upgrading to a larger App Engine instance] that fits your needs.

[WARNING]
Be mindful of costs when upgrading.
Larger instances most likely incur more fees.
