= Troubleshooting Production Mode

This page provides some suggestions in case you have problems taking Vaadin applications to production.


== Verifying Production Mode Artifact

Vaadin Servlet configures itself from the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file, which is located in the `META-INF/VAADIN/config/` resource package. 

The location of resources differs, though, for different artifact types. For example, the Spring Boot `JAR` file places resources into the `BOOT-INF/classes/` folder in the `JAR` file. Whereas, the `WAR` archive puts them in the `WEB-INF/classes/` folder.

If production mode has been activated, the contents of the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` should be as follows:

.flow-build-info.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "compatibilityMode": false,
  "productionMode": true,      <1>
  "enableDevServer": false,
  "chunks": {
    "fallback": {
      "jsModules": [
        "@vaadin/vaadin-grid/src/vaadin-grid-tree-toggle.js",
// etc etc
        "frontend://ironListConnector.js"
      ],
      "cssImports": [
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

<1> The `productionMode` property is set to `true`.

It's very important that this file be precise once on the classpath in production mode. If the file is missing, Vaadin Servlet uses other means to examine whether it's running in production mode: the value of the `vaadin.productionMode` system property; or the [filename]`flow-server-production-mode.jar` being present on the classpath, or similar. 

Depending on the outcome, Vaadin may throw an exception at runtime like this:

----
Failed to determine project directory for dev mode...
----

Or it may return a message like this:

----
The compatibility mode is explicitly set to 'false', but there are neither 'flow-build-info.json' nor 'vite.config.ts' files
----

Vaadin may also decide to start in development mode. The Vaadin configuration is then governed by a different set of rules: for example, the `project.basedir` property or similar.


=== `flow-build-info.json` File 

The project [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file is generated by the Vaadin plugin, in the `prepare-frontend` Maven goal. It's then modified in the `build-frontend` task to enable production mode.

If the file is present multiple times on the classpath, then Vaadin tries to choose the right one coming from the main project. If it isn't possible to do this, Vaadin prints a warning message and chooses the first [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file. This depends on the ordering in the classpath, which in turn may depend on the ordering of files in the file system or in the `WAR`/`JAR` archive.

This confusion can happen when a Vaadin add-on incorrectly includes the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file in the `JAR` file. This is a bug in the add-on packaging, which needs to be fixed. Also, the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file needs to be removed from the add-on's `JAR` file.

For the reasons stated, make sure the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file is on the classpath only once, and is always coming from your main project.


=== `stats.json` File 

A file named [filename]`META-INF/VAADIN/config/stats.json` is generated by the Maven plugin, as well. It's important to check for the presence of this file in the resources folder.

When packaging for production, a Vite executable is run. This happens in the `build-frontend` Maven goal. Vite is then responsible for packaging everything from `frontend/` and `node_modules` into the pre-compiled JavaScript files bundle. The bundle is located in the `META-INF/VAADIN/build/` resource folder. The folder contents should look like this:

----
├── FlowBootstrap.0b77bed3.js
├── FlowBootstrap.0b77bed3.js.br
├── FlowClient.947c8d40.js
├── FlowClient.947c8d40.js.br
├── generated-flow-imports-fallback.348e3eaf.js
├── generated-flow-imports-fallback.348e3eaf.js.br
├── generated-flow-imports.b6dfc59f.js
├── generated-flow-imports.b6dfc59f.js.br
├── indexhtml.e5efd5b3.js
├── indexhtml.e5efd5b3.js.br
├── webcomponenthtml-5467a14d.js
└── webcomponenthtml-5467a14d.js.br
----

Note, the hashes differ with each build.


== Common Issues

Below are some common issues faced when attempting to go to production with an application, along with suggestions for resolving them.

The application won't start after adding the `flow-server-production-mode` dependency.::
One potential cause of this problem is that the `build-frontend` of the `flow-maven-plugin` wasn't executed, either because the plugin is missing from the [filename]`pom.xml` file, or it's missing in the configuration. To resolve this, add the `flow-maven-plugin` to your Maven `build` block. Make sure it's visible in your production mode profile. Then enable the `build-frontend` goal.


When running multiple Vaadin applications on different ports on the same host, the browser tabs keeps reloading the page.::
The cause of page reloading is possibly due to server session expiration caused by all Vaadin application having the same HTTP session cookie name (e.g., `JSESSIONID`). Cookies for a given host are shared across all of the ports on that host, even though "same-origin policy", typically used by web browsers, isolates content retrieved via different ports. 
+
This mean the value from one application is overridden by another. To resolve this, configure a different HTTP session cookie name for each application instance. In a Spring Boot application, the cookie name can be set with the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html#application-properties.server.server.servlet.session.cookie.name[server.servlet.session.cookie.name] property. Another possibility is to get the [classname]`SessionCookieConfig` instance from the [classname]`ServletContext` and use the [methodname]`setName(String)` method to change cookie name.
