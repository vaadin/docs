= Creating Other Add-on Types

You can also use the https://github.com/vaadin/addon-starter-flow/archive/master.zip[Add-on Starter] that is typically used to <<integrating-a-web-component#,Integrate a Web Component>>, to create different kinds of add-ons, for example to create a data provider.

To create a generic project that can be used for any add-on:

. Leave the default Web Component URL in the starter form.
. Download the project.
. Delete:
** The `@NpmPackage` and `@JsModule` annotations.
** The UI component class.

The project supports directory deployment. 

*Example*: Using the `mvn clean install` command. 

[source, sh]
