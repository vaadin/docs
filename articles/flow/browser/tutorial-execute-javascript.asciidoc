= Executing JavaScript in the Browser

You can use server-side Java to execute simple JavaScript snippets in the browser. You can also pass parameters to the executed script as variables named `$0`, `$1` and so on. Vaadin automatically serializes and escapes the parameter values.

*Example*: Executing JavaScript in the browser and passing parameters. 

[source,java]
----
public static void logElementSize(String name,
        Element element) {
    Page page = UI.getCurrent().getPage();

    page.executeJs(
            "console.log($0 + ' size:', "
            + "$1.offsetWidth, $1.offsetHeight)",
            name, element);
}
----

The supported parameter types are `String`, `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Double`, `JsonValue` and `Element`.

The script is executed after the DOM tree has been updated based on server-side changes. The parameter value is `null` for a parameter of type Element that is not attached after the update (according to the server-side component structure)

.JavaScript evaluation scope
[NOTE]
The `page.executeJs()` method runs the JavaScript in the scope of the page (i.e. the `window` object).
Component and element scoped access is described in <<{articles}/flow/element-api/client-server-rpc#, Element API, Remote Procedure Calls>>. 

[NOTE]
The script is executed asynchronously, so you cannot directly pass values back to the server.
Instead, the returned `PendingJavaScriptResult` instance can be used to add a callback that is run when the result is available. 

Vaadin provides a ready-made solution (without custom JavaScript execution) to listen to browser window-resize events for the from the server side. See <<tutorial-flow-window-resize#,Browser Window Resize Events>> for more.
