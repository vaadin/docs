= Deploying Using Docker

A https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/[Docker container] is a standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.
Building a Docker image requires creating a [filename]#Dockerfile#, a text document containing all the commands needed to assemble and run that image.

== Creating a Dockerfile for New Vaadin Applications

For a Vaadin application, you can easily generate a [filename]#Dockerfile# by selecting the `Docker` option in https://start.vaadin.com/[Vaadin Start].
This makes building and running your container as simple as running the following two commands:

. To build your container (assuming your project name is `myapp`), run
+
`docker build . -t myapp:latest`

. To run your container on localhost.
+
`docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest`

[NOTE]
Either https://docs.docker.com/desktop/[Docker Desktop] or https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Server] must have already been installed on your machine.

== Adding a Dockerfile to Existing Vaadin Applications

If your Vaadin project was not generated with a [filename]#Dockerfile#, you can copy and paste the Dockerfile from a fresh Vaadin Start project into your project.

While we will not cover all of the commands that you can use in a [filename]#Dockerfile# here, let us quickly inspect the Dockerfile generated by Vaadin Start to help you customize it in your application.

A typical Dockerfile from Vaadin Start should look similar to the content below.

.`Dockerfile`

<1> Use the https://hub.docker.com/_/maven[official Maven image] as the base image. The variant used is the slim version as specified by the `maven:<version>-slim` syntax.
<2> Runs the `curl` command to download the Node.js binary.
<3> Updates apt and installs the Node.js binary downloaded in the previous step.
<4> Adds a new user called `myuser`.
<5> Changes the current working directory using the `WORKDIR` instruction.
<6> Modifies the ownership of the directory `/usr/src/app/` in the container volume.
<7> Switches to the `myuser` unix user.
<8> Copy the `pom.xml` file with the optional `chown` feature.
<9> Runs `maven`.
<10> Coping files.
<11> Using `mvn` to build the production package.
<12> Sets the image for running the application
<13> Copying the generated jar file.
<14> Adds `myuser`.
<15> Switches to `myuser`.
<16> Opens port 8080 using the Dockerfile `EXPOSE` instruction.
<17> Runs the packaged jar file.
