= Troubleshooting Production Mode

== Verifying the Production Mode Artifact

Vaadin Servlet configures itself from the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file, which is located in the `META-INF/VAADIN/config/` resource package.
The location of resources differs for different artifact types, for example:

* Spring Boot `JAR` file places resources into the `BOOT-INF/classes/` folder in the `JAR` file;
* `WAR` archive places resources into the `WEB-INF/classes/` folder.

If production mode has been activated, the contents of the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` should be as follows:

.flow-build-info.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "compatibilityMode": false,
  "productionMode": true,      <1>
  "enableDevServer": false,
  "chunks": {
    "fallback": {
      "jsModules": [
        "@vaadin/vaadin-grid/src/vaadin-grid-tree-toggle.js",
// etc etc
        "frontend://ironListConnector.js"
      ],
      "cssImports": [
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

<1> The `productionMode` property is set to `true`.

It's very important to have this file exactly once on the classpath in production mode.

If the file is missing, Vaadin Servlet uses other means to examine whether it's running in production mode: the value of the `vaadin.productionMode` system property, or the [filename]`flow-server-production-mode.jar` being present on the classpath, or similar.
Depending on the outcome, Vaadin may throw an exception at runtime:

----
Failed to determine project directory for dev mode...
----

or

----
The compatibility mode is explicitly set to 'false', but there are neither 'flow-build-info.json' nor 'vite.config.ts' files
----

Vaadin may also decide to start in development mode; the Vaadin configuration is then governed by a different set of rules (for example, the `project.basedir` property or similar).

The project [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file is generated by the Vaadin plugin, in the `prepare-frontend` Maven goal, then modified in the `build-frontend` task to enable production mode.

If the file is present multiple times on the classpath, then Vaadin tries to choose the right one coming from the main project.
If it isn't possible to do this, Vaadin prints a warning message and chooses the first [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file, which depends on the ordering in the classpath, which in turn may depend on the ordering of files in the file system or in the `WAR`/`JAR` archive.

This can happen when a Vaadin add-on incorrectly includes the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file in the `JAR` file.
This is a bug in the add-on packaging, which needs to be fixed and the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file removed from the add-on's `JAR` file.

For the reasons stated above, keep in mind that you need to have the [filename]`flow-build-info.json` file on the classpath only once, and always coming from your main project.

A file named [filename]`META-INF/VAADIN/config/stats.json` is generated by the Maven plugin, as well.
It's important to check for the presence of this file in the resources folder.

When packaging for production, a Vite executable is run.
This happens in the `build-frontend` Maven goal.
Vite is then responsible for packaging everything from `frontend/` and `node_modules` into the pre-compiled JavaScript files bundle.
The bundle is located in the `META-INF/VAADIN/build/` resource folder.
The folder contents should look like this (the hashes differ with every build):

== Common Issues

After adding the `flow-server-production-mode` dependency, the application no longer starts::
One potential cause of this problem is that the `build-frontend` of the `flow-maven-plugin` wasn't executed, either because the plugin is missing from the [filename]`pom.xml` or it's missing in the configuration.
To fix this, add the `flow-maven-plugin` to your Maven `build` block (make sure it's visible in your production mode profile), and enable the `build-frontend` goal.


When running multiple Vaadin applications on different ports on the same host, the browser tabs keeps reloading the page::
The cause of page reloading is potentially due to server session expiration caused by all Vaadin application having the same HTTP session cookie name, for example `JSESSIONID`. Cookies for a given host are shared across all the ports on that host, even though the usual "same-origin policy" used by web browsers isolates content retrieved via different ports. This mean the value from one application is overridden by another one.
To fix this, configure a different HTTP session cookie name for every application instance.
In a Spring Boot application the cookie name can be with the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html#application-properties.server.server.servlet.session.cookie.name[server.servlet.session.cookie.name] property. Another possibility is to get the [classname]`SessionCookieConfig` instance from the [classname]`ServletContext` and use the [methodname]`setName(String)` method to change cookie name.
See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-8.5[HTTP State Management Mechanism RFC] for more information.
