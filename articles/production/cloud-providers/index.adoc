= Deploying Using Cloud Providers

Hilla applications are standard Java Web Applications, and as such can be deployed on most cloud services that support Java applications.

If your deployment uses multiple servers, be sure to configure sticky sessions on the load balancer.
This improves performance and makes your application development much easier.

[NOTE]
Sticky sessions are a load balancer feature that makes sure all requests from a particular user (session) are sent to the same server in a cluster.
This means that sessions do not need to be replicated between servers, significantly reducing server cluster complexity.

Some providers will require a pre-built `JAR` or `WAR` file, while others allow you to deploy, for example, directly from GitHub.
For this reason, we have split the documentation up into articles that each cover an individual cloud provider.

Even though deployment itself varies from provider to provider, we recommend you to read the <<.#, Production Mode>> article before delving into the tutorials, as this explains some common topics, such as what a production build is and how to do such a build.
