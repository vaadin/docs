= Deploying Using Cloud Providers

Vaadin applications are standard Java Web Applications and, as such, can be deployed on most cloud services that support Java applications.

If your deployment uses multiple servers, be sure to configure sticky sessions in the load balancer.
This improves performance and makes your application development much easier.

[NOTE]
Sticky sessions are a load balancer feature that makes sure all requests from a particular user (session) are sent to the same server in a cluster.
This means that sessions don't need to be replicated between servers, significantly reducing server cluster complexity.

Some providers require a prebuilt `JAR` or `WAR` file, while some allow you to deploy, for example, directly from GitHub.
For this reason, each cloud provider is covered in its own article.

Even though the deployment itself varies from provider to provider, you should read the <<../production-build#, Production Build>> article before delving into the tutorials, as it explains some common things, such as what a production build is and how to do such a build.
