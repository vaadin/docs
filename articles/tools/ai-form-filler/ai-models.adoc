= AI Form Filler Models

AI Form Filler provides two built-in LLM implementations using ChatGPT services: `ChatGPTService` and `ChatGPTChatCompletionService`.

Both models are quite good at understanding and processing natural language. In any case, it is advised to try both implementations to find out which one fits better with your requirements. Even if `ChatGPTChatCompletionService`, using the "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613" model, is more advanced, the LLM world isn't 100% predictable. You never know what model could work better.

== Implementing Custom AI Model Adapter

You can implement your own AI model adapter for ChatGPT or any other LLM provider. You should use one of the existing implementations as a template if you want to create a new adaptor. Internal parameters such as the model name, temperature, or max tokens are up to you to choose and parametrize. The methods you need to implement are the ones described by the [interfacename]`LLMService` interface.

First, you need to implement the [methodname]`getPromptTemplate()` method to create the prompt that is sent to the AI module. This method receives all the internal structures generated automatically from the target form. Then you need to implement the [methodname]`getGeneratedResponse()` method that sends the prompt to the AI module. This method has to guarantee that the response is a valid JSON object using the same format that is sent in the request.

Then pass your newly implemented service to the Form Filler constructor.

----
FormFiller formFiller = new FormFiller(formLayout, new MyGPTService());
FormFillerResult result = formFiller.fill(input);
