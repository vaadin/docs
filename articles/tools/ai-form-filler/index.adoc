== Features

AI Form Filler has the following features in this experimental preview:

*Easy to Use; Works Out-of-the-Box*::
Built-in prompt engineering performs the job of generating a request containing the information related to the target components that works out-of-the-box for most cases. Once you've defined your form, only a couple of lines are required to use the Form Filler.

*Context Instructions*::
API to add more context instructions for the AI module (e.g., target language, vocabulary explanation, source context).
+
Use these instructions to provide extra information to the AI module about the general context of the input source.

*Component Instructions*::
API to add more component instructions for the AI module (e.g., field format, field explanation, field actions).
+
Use these instructions to give extra information to the AI module about a specific field when the built-in request or response of the form filler is not accurate enough.
