= AI Form Filler

The AI Form Filler addon is an experimental feature that provides an easy way for Flow users to create forms that are filled automatically from natural language input sources using ChatGPT technologies.

OpenAI ChatGPT is the large language model (LLM) model used by default with this feature. But any large language model can be adapted using the [interfacename]`LLMService` interface.

[WARNING]
.Experimental Feature
AI Form Filler is an experimental feature. It may be removed, altered, or limited to commercial subscribers in future releases.

== Features

AI Form Filler addon has the following features in this experimental preview:

*Supports Most Common Input Components of Flow*::

*Easy to Use; Works Out-of-the-Box*::

Built-in prompt engineering performs the job of generating a request containing the information related to the target components that works out-of-the-box for most cases. Once you've defined your form, only a couple of lines are required to use the Form Filler. 
|===
|===
*Context Instructions*::
API to add more context instructions for the AI module (e.g., target language, vocabulary explanation, source context). 
+
Use these instructions to provide extra information to the AI module about the general  context of the input source.
|===
|===
*Component Instructions*::
API to add more component instructions for the AI module (e.g., field format, field explanation, field actions). 
+
Use these instructions to give extra information to the AI module about a specific field when the built-in request or response of the form filler is not accurate enough.

=== AI Models

The Form Filler provides two built-in LLM implementations using ChatGPT services. Both models are quite good at understanding and processing natural language. In any case, it is advised to try both implementations to find out which one fits better with your requirements. Even if ChatGPTChatCompletionService, using gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 model, is more advanced, the LLM world is not something 100% predictable. You never know what model could work better. 

==== Implementing Custom AI Model Adapter

You can implement your own AI model adapter for ChatGPT or any other LLM provider. It is advised to use one of the existing implementations as a template if you want to create a new adaptor. Internal parameters such as the model name, temperature, or max tokens are up to the developer to be chosen and parametrized. The methods that are mandatory to be implemented are the ones described by the [interfacename]`LLMService` interface. 

First you need to implement the [methodname]`LLMService::getPromptTemplate` method to create the prompt that is sent to the AI module. This method receives all the internal structures generated automatically from the target form. Then you need to implement the [methodname]`LLMService::getGeneratedResponse` method that actually sends the prompt to the AI module. This method has to guarantee that the response is a valid JSON object using the same format that is sent in the request.

Then use your new implemented service on the Form Filler constructor.

[source,java]
----
   FormFiller formFiller = new FormFiller(formLayout, new MyGPTService());
   FormFillerResult result = formFiller.fill(input);
