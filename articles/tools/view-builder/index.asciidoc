= View Builder

View Builder is a feature in the Vaadin Start application generator. View Builder enables you to assemble custom views by dragging and dropping items into place. Once you’re done, you can download the application and run it locally. 
View Builder generates the required code declarations, configurations, and sample data for your application.

[TIP]
View Builder is a part of Vaadin Start. You can customize the application theme, settings (., Java version), etc. before downloading or sharing the application.

== Creating a Custom View

Go to https://start.vaadin.com and log in to get started. Select the [guilabel]*VIEWS* tab, click [guilabel]*+ Add View*, and choose [guilabel]*Custom* from the drop-down menu. This opens View Builder.

=== Choosing a Template

Choose one of the four layout templates and add an optional header, footer, or both. Click [guilabel]*Start building* to proceed to content and actions.

You can edit the layout later, such as adding a margin, by clicking it once it's in the view.

=== Building a View

Drag items from the menu in the side navigation bar. You can place content and add containers with some pre-made components.

=== Creating a Layout

If you want to place items in a row, for example, you can do this by dragging a `Horizontal Layout` component from the bottom of the side navigation and then adding items to it. Click on the items to expand them to fill up the space in the layout.

Perform the actions with a `Vertical Layout` if you want the items placed from top-to-bottom instead.

.Sharing Views is a Preview Feature
[NOTE]
The sharing feature is in preview. Give it a try and file an issue if you encounter a bug by clicking the [guilabel]*submit feedback* button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.

==== Deleting Items

If you’re unhappy with an item or its placement, you can delete it by clicking the item in the view and selecting the trashcan icon.

You can add as many views as you want before downloading the project.
