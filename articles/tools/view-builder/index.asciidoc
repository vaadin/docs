View Builder is a tool in the Vaadin Start application generator. It allows you to assemble custom views by dragging and dropping items into place. When you’re done, you can download and run the application locally or share it with others who can customize it further.

View Builder generates the required code declarations, configurations, and sample data for your application.

.Theming & Other Features
[TIP]
View Builder is part of Vaadin Start. You can customize the application theme, settings (e.g., Java version), and more before downloading or sharing the application.


== Creating a Custom View

Go to https://start.vaadin.com and log in to get started. Select the [guilabel]`VIEWS` tab, click [guilabel]`+ Add View`, and choose [guilabel]`Custom` from the drop-down menu. This opens View Builder.

=== Choosing a Template

Choose one of the four layout templates and add an optional header or footer -- or both. Click [guilabel]`Start building` to proceed to content and actions.

You can edit the layout later, such as adding a margin, by clicking it once it's in the view.


=== Building a View

Drag items from the menu in the toolbar to the view. You can place content and add containers with some pre-made components.

=== Creating a Layout

If you want to place items in a row, for example, you can do so by dragging a `Horizontal Layout` component from the toolbar on the side and then add items to it. Click on the items to expand them so as to fill the space in the layout.

Do the same instead with a `Vertical Layout` if you want the items arranged from top-to-bottom.


==== Deleting Items

If you’re unhappy with an item or its placement, you can delete it by clicking the item in the view and selecting the trashcan icon.

== Publishing and Sharing the Project

Once you're ready, you can share the project with others either by sharing a link or by creating a GitHub repository for it. Click [guilabel]`Share...` to do so.

.Sharing is in preview.
[NOTE]
Sharing views is a preview feature. Give it a try. If you encounter a bug, though, file an issue by clicking the [guilabel]`submit feedback` button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.

== Downloading the Project

When you’re done with View Builder and ready to generate the application, click [guilabel]`Download` in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Incidentally, you can add as many views as you want before downloading the project.
