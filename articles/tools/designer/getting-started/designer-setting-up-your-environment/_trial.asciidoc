Please note that a separate license key is required for each developer.
If you choose not to supply a license, you will be unable to see your design.

If, for any reason, you need to remove or change a valid license, it is located in
[filename]`~/.vaadin/proKey` in UNIX systems and
[filename]`C:\Users++\++[replaceable]`#<username>##\.vaadin\proKey# in
Windows.
