As an alternative, you can skip the steps above and download the end result of directly: https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/crm-tutorial/archive/03-database-and-backend.zip[download the project as a zip from GitHub].

Next, follow the Designer installation instructions for your IDE. The tutorial uses IntelliJ IDEA, but everything demonstrated is also available in Eclipse.
