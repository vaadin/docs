[#add-route-to-main-view]
== Adding the Route to the Main View

We previously created a `main-view` design with a companion Java file.
Now we need to make the view accessible by adding the `@Route` annotation to the companion Java file.

. Expand the `src/main/java/com.example.application` package and open `MainView.java`.
. Add the `@Route("")` annotation at the beginning of the `MainView` class.

Your `MainView` class should now look like this:

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Tag("main-view")
@JsModule("./src/views/main-view.ts")
@Route("")
public class MainView extends LitTemplate {

    public MainView() {
    }

}
----

The `@Route` annotation maps http://localhost:8080/ to `MainView`.

[#layout-finished-run-the-project]
== Running the Project

Next, we run the project to see what the new layout will look like.

The easiest way to run the project for the first time is to:

. Open the `Application` Java class in `src/main/java/com/example/application/Application.java`
. Click the green play button next to the line which starts with `public class Application`.

This starts the application and automatically adds a run configuration for it in IntelliJ IDEA.
Later, when you want to run or restart the application, you can build, run/restart, stop and debug the application from the toolbar:

When the build is finished and the application is running.
Open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to see the result.
