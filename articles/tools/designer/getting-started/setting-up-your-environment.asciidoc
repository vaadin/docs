== Setting up a Java development environment

Before you can start developing your Java app web app with Designer, you need to install the necessary tools and set up your development environment.

If you need to set up your Java development environment from scratch, follow the steps in the link:https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin/setting-up-a-java-development-environment[Building Modern Web Apps with Spring Boot and Vaadin - Setting up a Java development environment] tutorial.

If you already have a working Java development environment, including a JDK, Maven, Git, Node.js, and an IDE, you can skip this step and proceed to set up a Vaadin project. The tutorial uses IntelliJ IDEA, but everything demonstrated is also available in Eclipse.

== Installing Google Chrome

When you open a design file with Designer, the source code shows in your IDE, while the visual editor opens up in the Chrome browser. If you do not have Chrome, follow link:https://www.google.com/chrome/[these instructions] to install it on your computer.

== Setting up a Vaadin project

The first step in any development project is to set up a project and get it running. When this is done, we will continue using the project with Vaadin Designer.  

Follow chapters 2-4 of the https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin[Building Modern Web Apps with Spring Boot and Vaadin] guide to set up a Vaadin project:
