[[designer.java]]
= Connect to Java

You can connect both components and data between Java and the UI made with Designer.
In practice, this is accomplished with a Java class that enables
Vaadin Flow to connect your Java code to the UI. In other words, you access the
UI defined in a design programmatically through the companion class for the design.

TL;DR To connect a component to Java:

. Make sure you have <<figure.designer.java.connectedcompanionfile, a companion Java class>> with [classname]#@JsModule# and [classname]#@Tag# annotations matching the design.
. Set the [literal]#id# attribute for the element.
. Click on the [guilabel]#connect# button for the element in the Outline.

[[designer.java.companion]]
== The Java Companion File

The Java companion file contains the class that connects
your Java code to the UI defined in the design. There can be only one companion class
for a design.

You may have already created the companion file at the time you
<<../getting-started/designer-getting-started#designer.getting-started.design, created the design>>
using the new design wizard. If that is the case you are all set. You can start
<<designer.java.components, connecting components>> and <<designer.java.data, data>>.

There is a companion file status indicator on the top right of the editor toolbar. The connection has
three states: <<figure.designer.java.nocompanionfile, no connected file>>, <<figure.designer.java.connectedcompanionfile, connected to a java companion file>> or <<figure.designer.java.connectedmultiplecompanionfiles, connected to multiple java files>>.

When you have connected your design with a Java companion file, you can simply navigate to the file by clicking on the connected indicator.
However, if you do not have a companion file for your design, you need to create one manually.
Here is a code snippet for a companion file that is a valid starting point for any design. It
has been written as if it was a companion to an imaginary [filename]#my-design.js#. You have
to adapt it by providing the correct values for your design to the [classname]#Tag# and
[classname]#JsModule# annotations. The class names are not relevant for Designer.

[source, java]
----
import com.vaadin.flow.templatemodel.TemplateModel;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.Tag;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.dependency.JsModule;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.polymertemplate.PolymerTemplate;

@Tag("my-design")
@JsModule("./src/views/my-design.js")
public class MyDesign extends PolymerTemplate<MyDesign.MyDesignModel> {

    public MyDesign() {
        // You can initialise any data required for the connected UI components here.
    }

    public interface MyDesignModel extends TemplateModel {
        // Add setters and getters for template properties here.
    }
}
----

In general, any Java class will be picked up by Designer as a companion file for the design, as
long as the class meets the following requirements:

. It is a descendant of [classname]#com.vaadin.flow.component.Component#
. It is annotated with
[classname]#com.vaadin.flow.component.Tag# annotation. The annotation's value matches the design's
tag in custom element definition (e.g. `customElements.define('my-design', MyDesign)`)
. The value of the [classname]#com.vaadin.flow.component.dependency.JsModule# annotation matches the design path.

So, if you have a specific need, you can freely customize the
companion class to match your demands. You can learn more about connecting designs and Java classes in
<<../../flow/polymer-templates/tutorial-template-basic, Flow documentation>>.

[[designer.java.components]]
== Connecting Components

Designer helps to connect the components used in the design to Java but before
that can happen you need three things:

. You need a companion file for the design. See the <<designer.java.companion>> for how to get one.
. The component you want to connect to Java should have its [classname]#id# property set to a unique value (among all the
[classname]#id# property values in the same design). If its [classname]#id# is empty, Designer will generate one for you.
. The project must have Vaadin Flow component integrations as dependencies. Those are needed to correctly set the type of the new field.

When a companion file for the design exists, you can connect components to Java using the [guilabel]#Outline# view. When you
hover over a component in the Outline and the component has a Java API, a connection button will appear on the same row
with the component name. By clicking the connection button, you can connect the component to Java. When the component is
connected, the connection button will stay visible in the outline.
This is illustrated in the following picture.

[[figure.designer.java.add]]
.Adding a Field

NOTE: When you make changes in your Java companion file, it will take a few seconds to update the status of the connection buttons
in the outline and the connection indicator on the toolbar.

Choosing to add the field in the previous picture will insert the following field to the companion class:

[source, java]
----
    @Id("vaadinFormItem")
    private FormItem vaadinFormItem;
----

Flow uses the [classname]#@Id# annotation to connect the UI component to the field. The value in the annotation must match the [classname]#id# property of the component in the design. Otherwise, you are free to change the type, name and visibility of the field. Just be careful not to break it for Flow.

Take a look at the Flow documentation to learn more about <<../../flow/polymer-templates/tutorial-template-components, binding components in Flow>>.

You can disconnect a component by clicking the connection button of a connected component. Disconnecting a component will
erase the corresponding field from the companion class along with its [classname]#@Id# annotation.

You should not have more than one companion class for a design, or more than one field annotated with
the same [classname]#@Id# value, but if you do, all of them will be shown in the Java checkbox tooltip so that
you can easily locate them to fix the problem manually.

[[designer.java.data]]
== Connecting Data

You can also bind data from Java to the UI. Designer provides you with a starting point
by adding the template model inner class into the companion file when the file is created.
You can learn more about binding data to designs in <<../../flow/polymer-templates/tutorial-template-bindings, Flow documentation>>.
