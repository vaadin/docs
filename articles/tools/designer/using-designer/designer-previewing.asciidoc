= Previewing

While creating a design, it is convenient to preview how the UI will behave in
different sizes and on different devices. There are a number of features geared
for this.

[[designer.previewing.resize]]
== Resizing viewport and presets

By resizing the viewport, you can preview how your design behaves in different sizes, just as if it was
displayed in a browser window that is being resized.

The current width and height of the viewport is reflected in the toolbar.

You can manually resize the viewport by grabbing just outside of an edge or
corner of the viewport, and dragging to the desired size.

Alternatively, you can type a specific viewport size directly in the width and fields in the toolbar.

Lastly, you can choose among a set of presets such as [guilabel]#Phone# to instantly preview the design on that size.
Open the preset menu by clicking the arrowhead to the right of the viewport size fields.

Using the preset menu, you can also add your own presets - for instance known portlet or dashboard tile
sizes, or other specific sizes you want to target.

To preview the design in the other orientation (portrait vs. landscape), press
the icon right of the preset menu button.

== Preview in browser

You can preview your design in a separate browser window. To open the design in a new
window, choose [guilabel]#Preview in browser# in the [guilabel]#Preview# menu located
at the right end of the toolbar.

In the new browser window, all designing tools and indicators are removed, and you
can interact with components - type text, open drop-downs, check boxes, tab
between fields, and so on. It allows you to quickly get a feel for, for
instance, how a form will work when filling it in.

== Preview on device

You can preview your design on another device that is connected to the same network as
the computer you are running Designer on.

When you click [guilabel]#Start previewing on devices# in the [guilabel]#Preview# menu,
Designer becomes visible in your local network and other devices can connect to it.

When previewing on devices has been started, the [guilabel]#Preview# menu will display
a QR code that contains the URL of the design. You can scan the QR code with your mobile
device and navigate to the URL to view and interact with the design. If you want to share the design with another
computer on the same network, you can click [guilabel]#Copy link# in the menu to copy the design's URL to
clipboard. You can then paste the URL to an email or a chat message, for instance, and the recipient
can open the link in their browser.

Multiple computers and devices can be connected at once,
and they are all updated live as you change the design in the IDE. This is an
awesome way to instantly preview results on multiple devices and
browsers, or to show off a design and collaborate on it - for instance in a
meeting setting.
