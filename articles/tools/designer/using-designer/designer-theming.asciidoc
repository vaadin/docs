Vaadin Designer supports theming the same way as https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/theme/theming-overview.html[Flow].
When a design is opened, Vaadin Designer:

* Loads the selected https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/theme/using-component-themes.html[component theme].
* Automatically loads the https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/theme/application-theming-basics.html[application theme],
i.e. `shared-styles.html`.
* Loads all CSS files in `@CssImport` annotations. Check out https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/theme/theming-crash-course.html[Theming Web Components] for more details.

You can change component theme used by Designer from the project settings. Component themes have different look and
feel as well as styles declarations.
Changing Designer component theme setting will not affect your Flow project. Likewise, your Flow project theme setting
will not be reflected in Designer.

Designer component theme setting only affects how designs are rendered by Designer.
Typically, you will match this with your application's component theme.

The default component theme is `Lumo`. `Material` component theme is also available. Both themes have
"light" and "dark" color https://vaadin.com/docs/v12/flow/theme/using-component-themes.html#theme-variants[variants].

User should provide all styling through the application theme, if `None` component theme was selected.

The [guilabel]#None# component theme will be used as a fallback if project is missing necessary dependencies for the selected theme,
for example if `vaadin-material-styles` JAR is not available in the classpath.

Theme settings will be stored in your project's root folder under [filename]#.vaadin/designer/project-settings.json# so that the
settings can be preserved and thereby shared with everyone who works with Designer on the project.
