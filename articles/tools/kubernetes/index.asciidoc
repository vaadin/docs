Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

The Kubernetes Kit is used to integrate your applications with Kubernetes to be able to deploy your Vaadin Flow applications on-premises or to the cloud.

The Kubernetes Kit enables teams to deploy seamlessly and operate Vaadin Java-based applications built using Flow.
The Kit helps teams to quickly create Vaadin applications that are scalable, highly available, and user-friendly.
Specifically, the enables the following:
- Non-disruptive rolling updates that don't interrupt user sessions, reducing the cost and inconvenience of after-hours deployments. 
- Horizontal scalability, saving on cloud costs by allowing your application to scale down without impacting active users' sessions, and scale up when needed.
- High availability, enabling users to keep their active sessions and continue using your application even if a server fails.
- “serialization helpers” that make it faster and easier to fully leverage horizontal scaling and fail-over.
