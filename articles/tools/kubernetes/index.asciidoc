Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

The Kubernetes Kit is used to integrate applications with Kubernetes to be able to deploy Vaadin Flow applications on-premise or the cloud.

The Kubernetes Kit enables developers to deploy seamlessly and operate Vaadin Java-based applications built using Vaadin Flow. It helps them to quickly create Vaadin applications that are scalable, highly available, and user-friendly. Specifically, it enables the following:

- Non-disruptive rolling updates that don't interrupt user sessions, reducing the cost and inconvenience of after-hours deployments. 
- Horizontal scalability, saving on cloud costs by allowing applications to scale down without impacting active user sessions, and scale up when needed.
- High availability, enabling users to keep their active sessions and continue using your application even if a server fails.
- Serialization helpers that make it faster and easier to leverage fully horizontal scaling and fail-over.
