== Features

Kubernetes Kit is used to deploy Vaadin Flow applications on-premise or the cloud using Kubernetes. It helps you in creating applications that are scalable, highly available, and user-friendly. Specifically, it enables the following:

- Horizontal scalability, saving on cloud costs by allowing applications to scale down without impacting active user sessions, and scale up when needed.
- High availability, enabling users to keep their active sessions and continue using your application even if a server fails.
- Non-disruptive rolling updates that don't interrupt user sessions, reducing the cost and inconvenience of after-hours deployments.
- Serialization helpers that make it faster and easier to leverage fully horizontal scaling and fail-over.
