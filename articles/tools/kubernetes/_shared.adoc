.Potential side-effects from serialization when using extended debug info.
[CAUTION]
The `sun.io.serialization.extendedDebugInfo` system property can be useful in making exception messages more verbose during serialization. The `toString()` method is used to represent serialized objects, and in rare cases this can cause issues which are not related to serialization. For example, with Hibernate, [classname]`PersistentList.toString()` forces initialization of the lazy loaded collection. If this happens without an active Hibernate session, an exception is thrown.

.Image Not Found by Cluster
[NOTE]
====
Depending on the Kubernetes cluster you're using, you may need to publish the image to a local registry or push the image to the cluster. Otherwise, the image will not be found. Refer to your cluster documentation for more information.

If you're using `kind` on a local machine, you need to load the image to the cluster like so:

[source,terminal,subs="+attributes"]
kind load docker-image my-app:{image-version}

In a production environment you can publish the image to a registry that is accessible by the cluster.
