.Enable serialization extended debug information
[TIP]
When facing exceptions on serialization phase, it may be useful to set the `sun.io.serialization.extendedDebugInfo` system property to make Java serialization verbose. However, in order to represent the objects being serialized, the `toString()` method is used, and in rare cases this may cause issues not related to serialization.
For example, Hibernate [classname]`PersistentList.toString()` forces initialization of the lazy loaded collection. If this happens without an active Hibernate session, an exception is thrown.
