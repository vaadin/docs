= Swing Application Configuration

== Maven Setup

The Swing application will need the following dependency to be added:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>swing-kit-client</artifactId>
    <version>{swing-kit-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Environment Variables

When using MacOS or Linux, the following JVM Parameters must be added to run the application:

[source]
----
--add-opens java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.desktop/sun.lwawt=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.desktop/sun.lwawt.macosx=ALL-UNNAMED
----

On Windows systems there are no such requirements.

=== System Home Folder Usage

The rendering process stores a file in the home folder of the system, which is downloaded from the internet, if not already present.
This will likely happen silently the first time the Swing application is executed.
