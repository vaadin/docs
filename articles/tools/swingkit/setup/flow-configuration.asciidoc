= Flow Application Configuration

== Maven Setup

In preparation for Maven, your Vaadin application will need to include the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>swing-kit-flow</artifactId>
    <version>{swing-kit-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Enable Swing Kit in Views

Any Vaadin views that you want to render inside your Swing application will need the [annotationname]`@Bridge` annotation. See the example here:

[source,java]
----
@Bridge
public class MainView extends HorizontalLayout {
}
----
