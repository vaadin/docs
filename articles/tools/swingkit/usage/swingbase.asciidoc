= Swing Usage for Swing Kit

== JVaadinPanel

A Vaadin view can be rendered as a Swing component like so:

[source,java]
----
JVaadinPanel vaadinPanel = SwingVaadinClient.getBuilder().build(vaadinViewUrl);
----

The [classname]`JVaadinPanel` class extends the [classname]`Panel` component, and can be added to standard Swing layouts.
You can check when the page has been fully loaded by using the [methodname]`isReady()` method.

== Handle Flow Swing Kit Events

Events emitted from the Flow application can be handled with [methodname]`addEventListener()`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
JVaadinPanel vaadinPanel = SwingVaadinClient.getBuilder().build(vaadinViewUrl);
vaadinPanel.addEventListener("myEvent", (VaadinSwingEvent event) -> {
                // Handle recieved event
});
----
