= Taking and Comparing Screenshots

You can take and compare screenshots with reference screenshots taken earlier.
If there are differences, you can fail the test case.

[[testbench.screenshots.parameters]]
== Screenshot Parameters

The screenshot configuration parameters are defined with static methods in the
`com.vaadin.testbench.Parameters` class.

`screenshotErrorDirectory`(default: `null`):: Defines the directory where screenshots for failed tests or comparisons are stored.
`screenshotReferenceDirectory`(default: `null`):: Defines the directory where the reference images for screenshot comparison are stored.
`screenshotComparisonTolerance`(default: `0.01`):: Screen comparison is usually not done with exact pixel values, because rendering in browser often has some tiny inconsistencies. Also image compression may cause small artifacts.
`screenshotComparisonCursorDetection`(default: `false`):: Some field component get a blinking cursor when they have the focus. The cursor can cause unnecessary failures depending on whether the blink happens to make the cursor visible or invisible when taking a screenshot. This parameter enables cursor detection that tries to minimize these failures.
`maxScreenshotRetries`(default: `2`):: Sometimes a screenshot comparison may fail because the screen rendering has not yet finished, or there is a blinking cursor that is different from the reference screenshot. For these reasons, Vaadin TestBench retries the screenshot comparison for a number of times defined with this parameter.
`screenshotRetryDelay`(default: `500`):: Delay in milliseconds for making a screenshot retry when a comparison fails.

[NOTE]
If the directory names are not absolute, they are relative to the folder you run the tests from. When using Maven, this is typically the root folder of the project.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Before
public void setUp() throws Exception {
    Parameters.setScreenshotErrorDirectory(
        "screenshots/errors");
    Parameters.setScreenshotReferenceDirectory(
        "screenshots/reference");
    Parameters.setMaxScreenshotRetries(2);
    Parameters.setScreenshotComparisonTolerance(1.0);
    Parameters.setScreenshotRetryDelay(10);
    Parameters.setScreenshotComparisonCursorDetection(true);
}
----



[[testbench.screenshots.failure]]
== Taking Screenshots on Failure

Vaadin TestBench can take screenshots automatically when a test fails. To enable
the feature, you need to include the `ScreenshotOnFailureRule` JUnit
rule with a member variable annotated with `@Rule` in the test case
as follows:


[source,java]
----
@Rule
public ScreenshotOnFailureRule screenshotOnFailureRule =
    new ScreenshotOnFailureRule(this, true);
----

Notice that you must not call `quit()` for the driver in the
`@After` method, as that would close the driver before the rule
takes the screenshot. The rule automatically calls `quit()` on the driver (controlled by the `true` parameter) so you can remove any calls to `getDriver().quit()`.

The screenshots are written to the error directory defined with the
`screenshotErrorDirectory` parameter. You can configure it in the
test case setup as follows:


[source,java]
----
@Before
public void setUp() throws Exception {
    Parameters.setScreenshotErrorDirectory("screenshots/errors");
    ...
}
----


[[testbench.screenshot.comparison]]
== Taking Screenshots for Comparison

Vaadin TestBench allows taking screenshots of the web browser window with the
`compareScreen()` command in the `TestBenchCommands`
interface. The method has a number of variants.

The `compareScreen(File)` takes a `File`
object pointing to the reference image. In this case, a possible error image is
written to the error directory with the same file name. You can get a file
object to a reference image with the static
`ImageFileUtil.getReferenceScreenshotFile()` helper method.


[source,java]
----
assertTrue("Screenshots differ",
           testBench(driver).compareScreen(
               ImageFileUtil.getReferenceScreenshotFile(
                   "myshot.png")));
----

The `compareScreen(String)` takes a base name of the
screenshot. It is appended with browser identifier and the file extension.


[source,java]
----
assertTrue(testBench(driver).compareScreen("oneplustwo"));
----

The `compareScreen(BufferedImage, String)`
allows keeping the reference image in memory. An error image is written to a
file with a name determined from the base name given as the second parameter.

Screenshots taken with the `compareScreen()` method are compared to
a reference image stored in the reference image folder. If differences are found
(or the reference image is missing), the comparison method returns
`false` and stores the screenshot in the error folder. It also
generates an HTML file that highlights the differing regions.

[[testbench.screenshot.comparison.error-images]]
=== Screenshot Comparison Error Images

Screenshots with errors are written to the error folder, which is defined with
the `screenshotErrorDirectory` parameter described in
<<testbench.screenshots.parameters>>.

For example, the error caused by a missing reference image could be written to
`screenshot/errors/oneplustwo_mac_chrome_64.png`.

Screenshots cover the visible page area in the browser. The size of the browser
is therefore relevant for screenshot comparison. The browser is normally sized
with a predefined default size. You can set the size of the browser window in a
couple of ways. You can set the size of the browser window with, for example,
`driver.manage().window().setSize(new Dimension(1024, 768));` in
the `@Before` method. The size includes any browser chrome, so the
actual screenshot size will be smaller. To set the actual view area, you can use
`TestBenchCommands.resizeViewPortTo(1024, 768)`.


[[testbench.screenshot.comparison.reference-images]]
=== Reference Images

Reference images are expected to be found in the reference image folder, as
defined with the `screenshotReferenceDirectory` parameter described
in <<testbench.screenshots.parameters>>. To create a reference image, just copy
a screenshot from the `errors/` directory to the
`reference/` directory.

For example:

[source, sh]
----
$ cp screenshot/errors/oneplustwo_mac_chrome_64.png screenshot/reference/
----
Now, when the proper reference image exists, rerunning the test outputs success:

[source, sh]
----
$ java ...
JUnit version 4.5
.
Time: 18.222

OK (1 test)
----

[[testbench.screenshots.comparison.masked]]
=== Masking Screenshots

You can make masked screenshot comparison with reference images that have
non-opaque regions. Non-opaque pixels in the reference image, that is, ones with
less than 1.0 value in the alpha channel, are ignored in the screenshot
comparison.

[[testbench.screenshot.comparison.visualization]]
=== Visualization of Differences in Screenshots with Highlighting

Vaadin TestBench supports advanced difference visualization between a captured
screenshot and the reference image. A difference report is written to a HTML
file that has the same name as the failed screenshot, but with `.html`
suffix. The reports are written to the same `errors/` folder as the
screenshots from the failed tests.

The differences in the images are highlighted with blue rectangles. Moving the
mouse pointer over a square shows the difference area as it appears in the
reference image. Clicking the image switches the entire view to the reference
image and back. The text "Image for this run" is displayed in the
top-left corner of the screenshot to distinguish it from the reference image, for example:

[[figure.testbench.screenshot.comparison.visualization.highlighting]]
.A highlighted error image
image::img/screenshot-html-output.png[]



[[testbench.screenshot.comparison.practices]]
== Practices for Handling Screenshots

Access to the screenshot reference image directory should be arranged so that a
developer who can view the results can copy the valid images to the reference
directory. One possibility is to store the reference images in a version control
system and check-out them to the `reference/` directory.

A build system or a continuous integration system can be configured to
automatically collect and store the screenshots as build artifacts.
