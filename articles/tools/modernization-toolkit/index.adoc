Extend the usefulness of your existing applications and accelerate their transformation to modern Java and the modern web. Vaadin's Modernization Toolkit contains the features and refactoring recipes you need to get the most value possible from working, tested applications.

Thanks to the automation in Modernization Toolkit, transformation to the latest Vaadin version can take as much as 90% less effort than it would to rewrite and test from scratch.

The toolkit contains the following components:

- <</tools/modernization-toolkit/dragonfly#, Dragonfly Transpiler>> to apply a gentle refactoring to your source code using recipes preconfigured by Vaadin experts.
- <</tools/modernization-toolkit/feature-pack#, Feature Pack>> to identify and isolate useful features from your current tech stack and make them available in your new application.
- <</tools/modernization-toolkit/analyzer-for-eclipse#, Analyzer for Eclipse>> and <</tools/modernization-toolkit/analyzer-for-maven#, Analyzer for Maven>>, which are free components that help you self-assess your current Java application for the task at hand.
