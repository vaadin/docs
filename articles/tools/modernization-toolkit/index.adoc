Extend the usefulness of your existing applications and accelerate their transformation to modern Java and the modern web. Vaadin's Modernization Toolkit contains the features and refactoring recipes you need to squeeze the most value possible out of your working, tested applications.

Thanks to the automation in Modernization Toolkit, your transformation to the latest Vaadin version can take as much as 90% less effort than it would to rewrite and test from scratch.

- <</tools/modernization-toolkit/feature-pack#, Feature Pack>> to identify and isolate useful features from your current tech stack and make them available in your new application
- Analyzers for <</tools/modernization-toolkit/analyzer-for-eclipse#, Eclipse>> or <</tools/modernization-toolkit/analyzer-for-maven#, Maven>> which are free components that help you self-assess your current Java application for the task at hand
