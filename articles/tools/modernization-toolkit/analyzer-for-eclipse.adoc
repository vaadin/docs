= Preparing your Application with Modernization Toolkit Analyzer for Eclipse

Modernization Toolkit Analyzer for Eclipse is a tool to assess how well your applications fit the latest Vaadin versions when migrating with the Vaadin Modernization Toolkit. 

The Modernization Toolkit is a Vaadin product that accelerates your migration project. It has two components - a Dragonfly transpiler that does automated refactoring of your code, and a Feature Pack that identifies and isolates useful features from your application's current application platform and makes them available in Vaadin Flow.

The Analyzer works by parsing your project's Java code and resolving your application's references to the libraries you specify, and outputting the high-level results to the Eclipse IDE console. The Analyzer comes with two configuration presets for commonly occurring libraries in Swing applications and Vaadin 7 and 8 applications.

The Analyzer report is something you can copy and share with your colleagues, application stakeholders, or with Vaadin experts to discuss. This will give you some concrete data to consider and can be the start of your discovery and planning for your application’s future.


== How to install

You can install the Modernization Toolkit Analyzer for Eclipse through the Eclipse Marketplace or these sites:

https://vaadin.com/eclipse 

https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/vaadin-tools


== Limitations

To satisfy organizations with strict security policies on installing tools in their network, the Modernization Toolkit Analyzer is limited as follows:

- If an internet connection is not possible from the location where the Analyzer is to be run, it is possible to download the coverage data files locally and run them there. Contact Vaadin to get information on how to set this up. By default, the Analyzer connects to the Vaadin servers to access the most up-to-date coverage data;
- The Analyzer does connect to Vaadin servers to retrieve data files but does not send any information to Vaadin. You have full discretion over what about your application or the Analyzer report you would discuss with Vaadin. The Analyzer tool does not have any feature for transmitting information so you cannot use it either on purpose or accidentally to send information;
- It doesn't change your code; and
- It writes all output to the Eclipse console, nothing to disk.


== Using Modernization Toolkit Analyzer
To use Modernization Toolkit Analyzer with Eclipse, there are a few things to do: 

<1> first, make sure Eclipse is ready to use the plugin; 
<2> check that your application projects are ready to be analyzed; 
<3> run the Analyzer; and finally 
<4> interpret the results. 

These steps are described below.


=== Step 1: Prepare Eclipse 
Modernization Toolkit Analyzer is distributed as a single-file Eclipse plugin JAR that you can copy into the Eclipse /plugins, or the /dropins folder where you open your current project. You may need to restart Eclipse after copying the file. You’ll then see a button with a Vaadin logo (i.e., ]>) appear in the toolbar and an “Analyze” menu option. You may find it more convenient to download the plugin from the Eclipse marketplace.

|===
| Latest Version
| By default the Modernization Toolkit Analyzer connects to Vaadin servers when it starts to fetch information about the latest set of transformation rules.  You do not need to be running the latest version of the Analyzer to get the latest data, but the Analyzer will warn you if your version is incompatible with the latest data formats and prompt you to get a new version.

=== Step 2: Prepare your Project
The Modernization Toolkit Analyzer for Eclipse depends on the Eclipse environment to resolve all names in your code with the inheritance hierarchy and JARs in which they’re declared. Eclipse is robust and can resolve names in sources that contain errors, so the Analyzer may work even if your project has hundreds of Maven or Java errors. However, the Analyzer typically won’t be able to resolve the errors themselves so for best results, ensure that your project is free of red lines and problems before launching Analyzer.


To save time, consider closing any project in your workspace that doesn’t contain references to the libraries you are searching for. The Analyzer will skip these libraries and give you your report more quickly.


=== Step 3: Launch and Configure the Analyzer
Launch the Analyzer by clicking the button in the toolbar that appeared after you installed the plugin. The Analyzer icon looks like the classic Vaadin logo. 


The tool starts with default settings that work with most Vaadin 7 or 8 applications. If your application is Vaadin 7, Vaadin 8, or Vaadin 8 with Vaadin 7 compatibility, you can just press the OK button and get started. If you have a Swing application, you can try the built-in presets for Swing by leaving the “default settings” checkbox active and selecting the “Swing” radio button.


For finer control, you can edit the pattern to include secondary libraries or add-ons in your search. For example, suppose you have a Vaadin application but you used the Viritin add-on a lot. You can edit the search pattern from the default “com.vaadin” to the semicolon-separated list of “com.vaadin;org.vaadin.viritin”. To make the pattern field modifiable, deselect the default settings checkbox and edit the field before pressing OK.


Once you press OK, a progress bar should appear to show its progress.


=== Finally: Interpret Results
When the progress bar reaches 100% and disappears, the analysis is finished. You can then view the output. The Modernization Toolkit Analyzer for Eclipse writes output in the Eclipse Console. If this is not visible, you can visualize it in the menu:


[source,terminal]

Window → Show View → Console

The report is text-only and summarizes statistics on the references in the project code to the pattern you entered. Emphasis is on method invocations, constructor invocations, and types. Method invocations are invocations in the project code of methods that are declared in classes that match the pattern. Constructor invocations are new keywords that are matched with constructors that are declared in classes that match the pattern. Types can refer to anywhere a type occurs in the code be it in an extends clause, a throws clause, or a local variable declaration, to name a few examples.


As a basic rule, a reference in any of these three categories is included in the statistics if it can be resolved to a class that matches the given pattern. This means that invocations on custom subclasses of Vaadin components in your project are included in the statistics if the method is inherited from its Vaadin superclass. Invocations on custom subclasses in your project won’t be included in the statistics if the methods invoked are declared in your own custom subclass.


The statistics include an indication of coverage. A higher coverage rate is always preferred. Coverage refers to a situation that is known and there is confidence that further perfective developer work is not required to achieve feature parity. 


Coverage assumes that the modernized application uses the Feature Pack and a handful of utility methods that help bridge the gap in behavior between the existing application and later versions.


As a final note, bear in mind that the Analyzer is taking a measurement of API use of your application but there are many possible factors that can skew the results or give an inaccurate reading.
