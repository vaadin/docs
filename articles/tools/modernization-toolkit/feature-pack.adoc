= Feature Pack 

Feature Pack is a part of the Modernization Toolkit. It is a collection of classes and components that isolate useful features from popular developer frameworks, and reproduce them in Vaadin Flow. The scope of Feature Pack was originally limited to Vaadin 7 and 8 features, but today it also includes Swing, AWT and select features from JGoodies and NetBeans.

Feature Pack replaces the older Classic Components project which aimed to be close drop-in replacements for a number of Vaadin 7 and 8 components and classes. As a part of the Modernization Toolkit, Feature Pack goes beyond Classic Components in its setup in a few ways: 

* Feature Pack shifts the emphasis from compile-time compatibility in Java and DOM equivalence, to features your developers can use. Unlike Classic Components, no part of Feature Pack is marked as "deprecated" because there is no horizon for when the support for Feature Pack will end. Also, unlike Classic Components, most if not all empty methods have been removed that do nothing but throw an UnsupportedException at runtime, leaving you only with a collection of classes and methods that work;
* Implementing Feature Pack in your application is something you can do as part of your regular software development lifecycle, or as part of a broader modernization project. As a tool for modernization, Feature Pack used by the Dragonfly transpiler that targets it with its refactoring rules.
