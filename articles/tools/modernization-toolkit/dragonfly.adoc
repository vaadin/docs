= Dragonfly Transpiler for Eclipse

Dragonfly Transpiler is the engine that applies a preconfigured set of Vaadin Framework-to-Flow or Swing-to-Flow transformation rules to an application. The Transpiler works either by applying the transformation to the full set of sources in the current Eclipse workspace, or by applying it to a selection made in the Eclipse Package Explorer.


== How to install

You can install the Dragonfly Transpiler for Eclipse through the Eclipse Marketplace or these sites:

https://vaadin.com/eclipse 

https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/vaadin-tools


== How to operate

Once you've installed Dragonfly, a "Migration Menu" option will appear in the main Eclipse menu. Switch your view so the Package Explorer, and not the Project Explorer, is active. Set the transformation in process by selecting "Transform Swing to Vaadin" or "Transform Vaadin 7/8 to Vaadin" from the Migration Menu.
