= Dragonfly Transpiler

Dragonfly Transpiler is the engine that applies a preconfigured set of Vaadin Framework-to-Flow or Swing-to-Flow transformation rules to an application. Dragonfly is a commercial tool that requires a valid license. The Transpiler works by applying the transformation to the full set of sources in the current Maven module or Eclipse workspace, or by applying it to a selection made in the Eclipse Package Explorer.


== Installing

You can install the Dragonfly Transpiler for Eclipse through the Eclipse Marketplace, `https://vaadin.com/eclipse`, or `https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/vaadin-tools`.


== Operating

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Versions = NO -->]

Once you've installed Dragonfly, a [guibutton]*Migration Menu* option appears in the main Eclipse menu. Switch your view so the Package Explorer is active -- not the Project Explorer. Set the transformation in process by selecting [guibutton]*Transform Swing to Vaadin* or [guibutton]*Transform Vaadin 7/8 to Vaadin* from the [guibutton]*Migration Menu*.


== Verifying Execution

When processing is complete, Dragonfly will place three log files in the `reports` folder of the user home. These include a `changereport` and a `csvreport` that give information on which rules have been executed and how they have changed the sources, and a `log` file that contains information about execution time for each source in the project.
