= Dragonfly Transpiler

Dragonfly Transpiler is the engine that applies a preconfigured set of Vaadin Framework-to-Flow or Swing-to-Flow transformation rules to an application. Dragonfly is a commercial tool that requires a valid license. The transpiler works by applying the transformation to the full set of sources in the current Maven module or Eclipse workspace, or by applying it to a selection of sources made by the developer in the Eclipse Package Explorer.


== Disclaimers

Dragonfly is a simplified, default-setting configuration of the rich and configurable tool used by Vaadin specialists when performing Vaadin upgrades or Swing-to-Vaadin migrations. Dragonfly is a refactoring tool that works using the same approach as your Java compiler to identify the pieces of your source code and resolve in what libraries these pieces are declared. Dragonfly comes with over 3000 rules that it can apply to make changes to Vaadin Framework and desktop applications. 

Dragonfly has thousands of rules but your application uses libraries with tens of thousands of APIs and classes. If you discover that Dragonfly has a rule for every API in your application, it is a rare coincidence and should not be the default expectation. Most applications get coverage percentages of between 70% - 90%. Still even with a partial solution, many developer teams have found that Dragonfly can significantly reduce the overall effort in a modernization project, reduce the number of errors found by users, increase consistency of the modernized code, and help deliver modernized applications to their users on or ahead of schedule.


== Limitations

All Dragonfly transformation is applied to Java code only. Dragonfly does not change pom.xml files or scss files or modify directory structures. 

Dragonfly assumes a transformation to the latest Vaadin 24. If you are not able to deploy Vaadin 24 in your organization for whatever reason, please reach out to your commercial contact at Vaadin to discuss.

Dragonfly Transpiler does not support the modification of rules or addition of new rules. Your project may benefit from a customization of the default ruleset, however. If this is the case, we  encourage you to reach out to your commercial representative to discuss how this could work. Vaadin has a standard service called "Fine-tuning" where Vaadin experts can quickly extend the ruleset with the rules you require.


== Warning

Dragonfly will modify the source code in your workspace. It is advised to ensure you are working on a safe copy before proceding. Dragonfly processes all of the files in your workspace or your selection in one single batch. So if you have a million lines of code, reserve about 90 minutes for the process to complete. 


== Installing

You can install the Dragonfly Transpiler for Eclipse through the Eclipse Marketplace, `https://vaadin.com/eclipse`, or `https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/vaadin-tools`.


== Operating

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Versions = NO -->]

Once you've installed Dragonfly, a [guibutton]*Migration Menu* option appears in the main Eclipse menu. Switch your view so the Package Explorer is active -- not the Project Explorer. Set the transformation in process by selecting [guibutton]*Transform Swing to Vaadin* or [guibutton]*Transform Vaadin 7/8 to Vaadin* from the [guibutton]*Migration Menu*.


== Verifying Execution

When processing is complete, Dragonfly will place three log files in the `reports` folder of the user home. These include a `changereport` and a `csvreport` that give information on which rules have been executed and how they have changed the sources, and a `log` file that contains information about execution time for each source in the project.
