= Exception Handling

Any exception not handled by the remote View is by default handled by Swing. Further, Swing shows the exception in a [classname]`JOptionPane`. This behaviour can be configured to catch any Vaadin exceptions from Swing, directly.


== Custom Handling

A custom handler for the exception can be used after disabling the default behaviour with the following:

[source,java]
----
vaadinPanel.disableDefaultExceptionHandler();
----

Add a custom exception handler by adding the following:

[source,java]
----
vaadinPanel.addEventListener(EventType.EXCEPTION, event -> {
    // Print to standard output the exception content
    System.out.println(event.getParams().get("content"));
});
----

Notice, that the event contains only [classname]`String` values instead of the original [classname]`Exception`. This is to avoid serialization errors due to different classpaths from the Vaadin application and the Swing application.
