= Getting Started with Swing Kit

:swing-kit-version: 1.0.0

To use Swing Kit, you need a Vaadin Flow application, using Vaadin 23 or later. You also need a Swing application running with Java 8 or later, as well as a Maven build system.

== Maven Setup

Add the following dependency to your Vaadin Flow application:

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-swing-kit-flow</artifactId>
    <version>{swing-kit-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Add the following dependency to your Swing application:

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-swing-kit-client</artifactId>
    <version>{swing-kit-version}</version>
</dependency>
----


== Swing Application Configuration

On macOS and Linux, the following JVM parameters must be added to run the Swing application:

[source]
----
--add-opens java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.desktop/sun.lwawt=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.desktop/sun.lwawt.macosx=ALL-UNNAMED
----

.Need Access to System Home Folder
[NOTE]
The rendering process stores a file in the home folder of the system, which is downloaded from the internet, if not already present. This happens the first time you run the Swing application.
