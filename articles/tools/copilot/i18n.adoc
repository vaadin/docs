The Internationalization panel can be used to convert static strings used in the UI to "internationalized" translation API calls, generate translation keys and populate the default translation property file with them.


== Selecting Strings for Internationalization

Strings can be selected in two ways: by manually selecting individual UI elements, or by clicking the [guibutton]*Find all static strings* button in the Internationalization panel, which automatically selects all elements containing static strings in the currently visible UI.

In both cases, the elements are listed in the Internationalization panel. Each element is identified by the string inside it -- and its HTML tag. These items can be expanded to reveal each string found in them. Those can be further expanded to reveal a proposed, automatically generated translation key, as well as the string that is to be associated with it in the translation file. Checkboxes can be used to select or deselect entire elements or individual strings. The "All static strings" checkbox above the list can be used to select or deselect all items.

By default, the list also shows elements and strings that are already internationalized, distinguished by a green checkmark symbol. Already internationalized elements can be hidden by toggling the "Show internationalized strings" switch at the top.


== Modifying Proposed Keys & Associated Strings

Copilot automatically generates a translation key for each static string. You can modify the key by expanding the item's details and editing the Key field, or pick another existing key from the drop-down list.

The string that is going to be associated with the key can also be edited. If an existing key is selected, the field where the associated string can be edited is locked by default to prevent accidentally modifying the string that is probably already used in other elements. You can unlock it by clicking the button in the field.


== Applying the Current Selection

The selected items are internationalized by clicking the [guibutton]*Apply* button at the bottom of the list. Once the conversion is completed, a summary is displayed in the Internationalization panel.


== Download Translation Files & Screenshots

Copilot also takes screenshots of the elements that it internationalizes. These can be used in the <<{articles}/control-center/localization#, Localization>> module in Control Center to provide translators with the context in which the strings are used.

The screenshots are stored in the local storage of the browser that was used to run internationalization in Copilot. To download the screenshots, as well as the translation files in the project, expand the [guibutton]*Localization Data* panel below the [guibutton]*Find all static strings* button, and click the [guibutton]*Download Zip* button. This file can then be uploaded into the Localization module in Control Center, where localizations to different languages can be conveniently edited.

The panel also provides a button for clearing the currently stored screenshots.


== Limitations

The internationalization feature expects translation property files to be stored in <<{articles}/flow/advanced/i18n-localization#, the standard Vaadin translation file folder>> `src/main/resources/vaadin-i18n`.

The default translation property file is expected to be called `translations.properties`, and files for other locales are expected to be named according to the [filename]`translations\_\[langcode\].properties` format, such as [filename]`translations\_en\_US.properties` for U.S. English.

Other folders and filename structures are currently not supported.
