= Updating Documentation from Vaadin

By default, the documentation project Git repository uses `https://github.com/vaadin/docs` as its origin. The default documentation content is derived from it. Since the Vaadin documentation is actively maintained, you might want to pull updates from it into your own documentation. Because it's in a Git repository, updates from it upstream can be merged to your local branch with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
git fetch && git merge origin/dsp -m "merge commit"
----

If everything goes well, that's all it takes and you can redeploy the site with the new updates in place.

If you've customized the documentation content to an extent that it has significantly diverged from the origin, you might encounter merge conflicts when you pull updates. Resolving the conflicts, often can be fairly straightforward. See https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts[instructions for addressing merge conflicts].


== Excluding Files

If you want to hide some files or folders in the origin, rather than removing them, you can use the https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout[sparse-checkout] feature in `git` to exclude them from the visible set of files. This way, you won't run into merge conflicts while pulling updates if the upstream repository has changes to files you've hidden locally.

You can control the sparse-checkout setup by editing the [filename]`.git/info/sparse-checkout` file and then running the following command to refresh the local workspace:

[source,terminal]
----
git read-tree -m -u HEAD
