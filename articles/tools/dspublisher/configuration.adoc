== Configuration Options

Environment variables override the JSON property configuration. The website needs to be rebuilt -- or restarted in development mode -- in order for changes to the configuration variables to take effect.

All _path_ options are relative to the content project folder.

|===
| ENV Variable +
JSON Property
| Description
| Default Value

// TODO not relevant for regular users, only when when using docs-app directly
// | `CONTENT_ROOT`  +
// N/A
// | Absolute or relative path to the content project.
// | `"../docs"`

| `CONFIG_PATH` +
N/A
| Path to configuration JSON files.
| `"dspublisher/config"`

| `THEME_PATH` +
`themePath`
| Path to theme customizations. See <<customization#,Site Customization>>.
| `"dspublisher/theme"`

| `ARTICLES_PATH`  +
`articlesPath`
| Path to the AsciiDoc articles.
| `"articles"`

| `EXAMPLES_IMPORT_PATH`  +
`examplesImportPath`
| Path to the dynamically imported custom element examples.
| `"frontend/demo"`

| `TITLE`  +
`title`
| The site title. Used as the main prefix in the page `<title>`. Also used in meta tags and sitemap generation. Not visible in the site UI.
| `"Docs"`

| `SITE_URL`  +
`siteUrl`
| The root URL of the site (i.e., the domain without a path). For example, `"https://example.com"`. A [filename]sitemap.xml is not generated unless this is provided.
| `""`


| `PATH_PREFIX`  +
`pathPrefix`
| The root path where the website is hosted. For example, if you deploy the site to `https://example.com/docs`, the path prefix should be `"/docs"`.
| `"/"`


| `PROXY_VAADIN_HOSTNAME`  +
`proxyVaadinHostname`
| The host name of the Vaadin project. Used for request proxying.
| `"localhost"`


| `EXAMPLES_INCLUDE_URL_PREFIX`  +
`examplesIncludeUrlPrefix`
| URL prefix from which JavaScript examples are included.
| `"/vaadin/web-component/"`


| `VAADIN_CONNECT_PREFIX`  +
`vaadinConnectPrefix`
| Prefix used for Vaadin Fusion endpoints. Replaces effectively only global `__VAADIN_CONNECT_PREFIX__` variables with the provided value.
| `"/connect"`


| `VERSIONS_URL`  +
`versionsUrl`
| An absolute URL to a JSON file that defines the available versions of the documentation. See example later on this page.
| `""`


| `VERSIONS`  +
`versions`
| A JSON object defining the available documentation versions. See example later on this page.
| `""`


| `DOCS_IMPORT_EXAMPLE_RESOURCES`  +
N/A
| If `"true"`, load all frontend resources up front when the first component sample is encountered. See <<editing#rendered-examples,Rendered UI Examples>> for more information.
| `undefined`
|===

You can prefix the environment variable names with `DOCS_` (e.g., `DOCS_TITLE`) if you need to avoid conflicts with other systems that use the same variable names. The `VERSIONS` variable is an exception, as it expects a JSON value, and providing that as a string through the command line would be verbose. For example:

// TODO versioning would benefit from a dedicated page/guide

.`versions.json`
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "title": "Vaadin 23",
    "shortTitle": "V23",
    "url": "/docs/latest"
  },
  {
    "title": "Vaadin 22",
    "shortTitle": "V22",
    "url": "/docs/v22"
  },
]
----

The `title` value is shown in the version drop-down, and the `shortTitle` value, if provided, is shown as the drop-down button value when that version is selected.


== Configuration JSON File

The configuration options with a JSON property can be overridden with a configuration file. The default configuration is the following:

.`default.json`
[source,json]
----
{
  "articlesPath": "articles",
  "themePath": "dspublisher/theme",
  "examplesImportPath": "frontend/demo",
  "examplesIncludeUrlPrefix": "/vaadin/web-component/",
  "vaadinConnectPrefix": "/connect",
  "proxyVaadinHostname": "localhost",
  "pathPrefix": "/",
  "versionsUrl": "",
  "versions": "",
  "siteUrl": "",
  "title": "Docs"
}
----

Create a `default.json` file in the content project, in the folder defined by the `CONFIG_PATH` variable -- `dspublisher/config`, by default -- and override the properties you need. You don't have to repeat the default values.

You can also define a [filename]`production.json` configuration file in the same folder, to use a different configuration for your production build.

With the configuration files in place, you can use execute `npm run dspublisher:start`, or `npm run dspublisher:build` without extra command-line parameters.
