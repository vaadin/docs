= Getting Started with Design System Publisher

Before using the Design System Publisher tool, you'll need to set up your environment. You'll need to have the following tools:

.Vaadin Development Tools

The documentation contains a Vaadin project for rendering UI examples, and you need to have the same development tools installed when doing Vaadin application development.

.Git

The CLI tool uses https://git-scm.com/[Git] to clone an initial copy of the documentation project, so make sure to have Git installed.

.Node.js

Design System Publisher uses https://nodejs.org/[Node.js]. Make sure it's installed. Version 16 is recommended.


== Create a New Project

Run the following command to create a new design system website project:

[source,terminal]
----
npx @vaadin/cli@2.7.0 dsp-init
----

include::{articles}/flow/_terminal.adoc[]

The tool asks for the name of your design system, which is used for things like the visible page title, and a folder name for the website project.

The initialization script should take about a minute to finish. Once done, you should have the website project in your current working directory. The project uses Git for version control.
