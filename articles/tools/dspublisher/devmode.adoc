= Development Server

To start up the development server of your documentation project, run the following command inside the project root folder:

[source,terminal]
----
npm run dspublisher:start
----

The first run needs to download the Design System Publisher package and install a lot of dependencies from Maven and npm and it might take a while to start up.
Subsequent starts are quicker, as the dependencies are already available.

Once the project is started, a browser is automatically opened at `\http://localhost:8000`.
