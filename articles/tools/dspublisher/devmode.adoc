= Development Server

To start up the development server of your documentation project, run the following command inside the project root folder:

[source,terminal]
----
npm run dspublisher:start
----

The first time this is run, it needs to download the Design System Publisher package and install many dependencies for Maven and npm. As a result, it might take a while to start. Subsequent starts are quicker.

Once the project is started, a browser is opened automatically at `\http://localhost:8000`.
