= Development Build

To start up the design system documentation project in development/authoring mode, execute the following command inside the project folder:

[source,terminal]
----
npm run dspublisher:start
----

The first run needs to download the Design System Publisher package and install a lot of (Maven and npm) dependencies so it might take a good while to have it fully running.
Subsequent start-ups are quicker, as the dependencies are already available.

Once the project is fully started, the browser is automatically opened at `\http://localhost:8000`.
Use a web browser to access the URL to see your design system documentation page live in development mode.
