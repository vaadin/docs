= Development Build

You can start up the Design System documentation project in development/authoring mode by running the following command inside the project folder:

[source,terminal]
----
npm run dspublisher:start
----

Note that the first run needs to download the Design System Publisher Docker image and install a lot of (Maven and npm) dependencies so it might take a good while (about ten minutes or so, depending on the network connection speed) to have it fully running.
Following start-ups are quicker (about four minutes) as the dependencies are already available.

Once the project is fully started, it prompts you to open `\http://localhost:8000`.
Use a web browser to access the URL to see your design system documentation page live in development mode.
