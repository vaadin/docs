= Custom Theme for Rendered UI Examples

A theme for rendered UI examples is used from a Maven repository, such as Maven Central or a local repository. Once you've <<{articles}/styling/application-theme#,created an application theme>> and <<{articles}/styling/advanced/multi-app-themes#,packaged it as a JAR file>>, you can install it to a repository.

Once the theme is installed in a repository, you can use it by adding a dependency for it to the [filename]`pom.xml` in the documentation project's root folder:

.[filename]`pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>exampletheme</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Next, the theme needs to be applied to the component examples. Set it as the <<{articles}/styling/advanced/parent-and-sub-themes#, parent theme>> for the default "docs" theme by adding `"parent": "exampletheme"` to the [filename]`frontend/themes/docs/theme.json` file as shown in the following:

.[filename]`frontend/themes/docs/theme.json`
[source,json]
----
{
  "lumoImports": ["typography", "color", "spacing", "badge", "utility"],
  "parent": "exampletheme"
}
----

The website needs to be rebuilt -- or restarted in development mode -- in order for the change to take effect.

.Theme for UI Examples vs. Website Styling
[NOTE]
This page is about the theme used for rendered UI examples, which is distinct from the documentation website's styles covered in the <<customization#,Site Customization>> documentation.
