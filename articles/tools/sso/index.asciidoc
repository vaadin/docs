SSO Kit provides all of the configuration needed to add single sign-on capabilities to your Vaadin applications, based on https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect]. However, it depends on Spring Boot and Spring Security.

The following identity providers are supported:

- https://www.okta.com/[Okta]
- https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak]
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory/[Azure Active Directory]

SSO Kit needs at least one OpenID Connect client configured on an instance of these providers.
