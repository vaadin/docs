SSO Kit is an add-on for Vaadin Flow that provides all the configuration you need to add single sign-on capabilities to your applications, based on https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect].
These are the currently supported identity providers:

- https://www.okta.com/[Okta^]
- https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak^]
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory/[Azure Active Directory^]

SSO Kit needs at least one OpenID Connect client configured on an instance of these providers.
