Observability Kit provides integration with industry-leading Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and observability tools to provide insight into both the frontend and backend of an application.

At its core, Observability Kit is a custom Java agent that runs with a Vaadin Flow application to collect telemetry data, including traces, metrics, and logs.

.New in Vaadin 24.1
[TIP]
Starting with Vaadin version 24.1, you can use Observability Kit <<configuration/#frontend-observability-configuration,to observe the frontend>> of your application.
