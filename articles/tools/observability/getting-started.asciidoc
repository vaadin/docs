= Getting Started with Observability Kit
:sectnums:

Observability is the ability to answer questions about an application and its infrastructure. The Vaadin Observability Kit can assist you in implementing this ability for Flow-based applications to obtain traceable, actionable information about your applications in production.

To help you get started with Observability Kit, this page covers the following topics:

- Downloading and configuring Observability Kit to export data to the infrastructure;
- Setting up the infrastructure for collecting and viewing observability data, such as traces and metrics;
- Running a Vaadin application with Observability Kit; and
- Adding frontend observability to an application.


== Download & Configure Observability Kit

Observability Kit is packaged as a Java agent based on the OpenTelemetry standard (see the <<{articles}/tools/observability/reference#,Observability Kit Reference>> page). To begin, you will need to download the Observability Kit:

link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vaadin/observability/vaadin-opentelemetry-javaagent/1.0.0/vaadin-opentelemetry-javaagent-1.0.0.jar[Download Observability Kit, role="button secondary water"].

Once Observability Kit has finished downloading, it needs to be configured to export traces to Jaeger, and metrics to Prometheus. For this, create an [filename]`agent.properties` file with the following contents:

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=agent-properties]


== Setup Infrastructure

You can use Jaeger to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics. They both run locally and are suitable for development and testing. For integration with other vendors, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/integrations#,Integrations>>.

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=jaeger-setup]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=prometheus-setup]


== Run the Application

You're now ready to run the application. If you don't have one, though, you can download an application from https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start], and create a production build with the following command:

```terminal
./mvnw package -Pproduction
```

Then run the packaged JAR file from the [filename]`target` folder:

include::./integrations/_run-app.asciidoc[]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=view-traces-metrics]


== Frontend Observability

Frontend Observability provides traces and spans containing information about operations that are initiated by the frontend of an application -- at the browser. For more information on the types of spans and attributes that are generated, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/reference#frontend-traces,Frontend Traces>> reference page.

[NOTE]
The Observability Kit Agent is still required to be able to view the frontend traces in an observability tool.

Frontend instrumentation is provided by a separate module dependency. You'll need to add Observability Kit as a dependency to the project like so:

.`pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
  <artifactId>observability-kit-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Now, clean, build and run your project. The frontend spans should now be sent to the observability tool you've configured.
