= Getting Started with Observability Kit
:sectnums:

This guide covers the following topics:

- setting up infrastructure for collecting and viewing observability data, such as traces and metrics;
- downloading Observability Kit, and configuring it to export data to the infrastructure;
- running a Vaadin application with Observability Kit.

== Setup Infrastructure

We use Jaeger to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics.
These are both run locally and are suitable for development and testing.
For integration with other vendors, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/integrations#,Integrations>>.

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=jaeger-setup]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=prometheus-setup]

== Download and Configure Observability Kit

Observability Kit is packaged as a Java agent based on the OpenTelemetry standard.
For more information, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/reference#,Reference>>.

Next, Observability Kit needs to be configured to export traces to Jaeger, and metrics to Prometheus.
For this, create an [filename]`agent.properties` file with the following contents:

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=agent-properties]

== Run the Application

If you do not have an application to use, you can download an application from https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start], and create a production build with the following command:

```terminal
./mvnw package -Pproduction
```

Then run the packaged JAR file from the [filename]`target` folder:

include::./integrations/_run-app.asciidoc[]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=view-traces-metrics]
