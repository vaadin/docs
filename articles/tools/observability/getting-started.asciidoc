= Quick Start Tutorial

This document will cover the following topics:

- Downloading the Observability Kit Java agent, and configuring it to export data to the infrastructure
- Setting up infrastructure for collecting and viewing observability data, such as traces and metrics
- Running a Vaadin application with the Java agent.

== Obtaining and Configuring the Agent

include::{articles}/tools/observability/_download-agent.asciidoc[opts=optional]

[NOTE]
====
Observability Kit is packaged as a Java agent based on the OpenTelemetry agent.
For more information, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/advanced/observability-agent#,Observability Kit Agent>>.
====

Next, the agent needs to be configured to export traces to Jaeger, and metrics to Prometheus.
For this, create an `agent.properties` file with the following contents:

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=agent-properties]

== Setup Infrastructure

For this tutorial, we are using Jaeger to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics.
These are both run locally and are suitable for development and testing.
For integration with other Vendors, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/integrations#,Integrations>>.

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=jaeger-setup]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=prometheus-setup]

== Run the Application

Start your application using one of the methods provided below.
If you don't have an application to use, you can download an app from https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start^], and run a production build using `mvn package -Pproduction`. Then run the packaged Jar file from the `target` folder, as described below.

include::./integrations/_run-app.asciidoc[]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=view-traces-metrics]
