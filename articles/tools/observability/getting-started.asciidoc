= Getting Started with Observability Kit
:sectnums:

Observability is the ability to answer questions about an application and its infrastructure. The Vaadin Observability Kit can assist you in implementing this ability for Flow-based applications to obtain traceable, actionable information about your applications in production.

To help you get started with Observability Kit, this page covers the following topics:

- Downloading and configuring Observability Kit to export data to the infrastructure;
- Setting up the infrastructure for collecting and viewing observability data, such as traces and metrics;
- Running a Vaadin application with Observability Kit; and
- Adding frontend observability to an application.


== Download & Configure Observability Kit

Observability Kit consists of two parts - the Starter dependency and the Agent.

The Starter dependency can be added to your project by adding the following to the pom:

.`pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
  <artifactId>observability-kit-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The Agent is based on the OpenTelemetry standard (see the <<{articles}/tools/observability/reference#,Observability Kit Reference>> page) and is packaged as a jar file.

.Download the Agent jar file
[IMPORTANT]
The Agent cannot be used as a dependency - it must be downloaded separately

link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vaadin/observability/vaadin-opentelemetry-javaagent/2.1.0/vaadin-opentelemetry-javaagent-2.1.0.jar[Download Observability Kit Agent, role="button secondary water"] and place it in the project directory.

Once the Agent has finished downloading, it needs to be configured to export telemetry to one or more observability tools.
In this guide, traces will be exported to Jaeger, and metrics to Prometheus.
To do this, create an [filename]`agent.properties` file in the project directory with the following contents:

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=agent-properties]


== Setup Infrastructure

This guide will use Jaeger to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics.
They both run locally and are suitable for development and testing.
For integration with other vendors, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/integrations#,Integrations>>.

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=jaeger-setup]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=prometheus-setup]


== Run the Application

You're now ready to run the application. If you don't have one, though, you can download an application from https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start], and create a production build with the following command:

```terminal
./mvnw package -Pproduction
```

Then run the packaged JAR file from the [filename]`target` folder:

include::./integrations/_run-app.asciidoc[]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=view-traces-metrics]
