= Observability Kit Reference
:toclevels: 2

Observability Kit is a custom Java agent based on the OpenTelemetry standard, with preconfigured instrumentation for Vaadin Flow applications.

A Java agent is a special set of classes which, by using the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html[Java Instrumentation API], can intercept applications running on the JVM and inject code to provide more functionality.

https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] is an emerging standard for generating, collecting and exporting telemetry data, such as traces, metrics, and logs. It's https://opentelemetry.io/vendors/[supported by various tools and vendors]. Vaadin tests and supports <<{articles}/tools/observability/integrations/index.asciidoc#,integration>> with a specific selection of vendors. Check the documentation for your preferred observability platform to learn how to use traces and spans.

.New Standard
[CAUTION]
Observability Kit should work with any vendor that supports the OpenTelemetry standard. However, support from specific vendors may still be limited or incomplete.

Observability Kit builds on the automatic instrumentation provided by OpenTelemetry by implementing instrumentation on Vaadin-specific classes. This provides plenty of framework-specific details that can be used to identify issues, track performance, or observe user behavior.


== Traces

A trace represents an operation that happened within the application. Traces consist of <<spans,spans>>, which are nested operations that happened during the trace (e.g., method, database or API calls). Spans can contain attributes, which contain information about the operation, as well as events indicating something occurring at a specific time.

Observability Kit collects traces for all requests made against the application, and generates spans for internal framework calls, as well as external calls to databases and remote services. Observability Kit can also be customized to provide specific details about what happens in the application. See the <<customization#, Customization>> page for more on this.

Observability Kit creates traces for all Flow-specific requests against the application, and spans for framework-specific operations. It also adds span attributes that can be used to filter traces or spans, or to inspect more details about an operation.

The following sections list the most relevant traces and spans, and their attributes created by Observability Kit.


=== UI Requests

This creates a trace for every request that's related to a UI, using the current view's route template as name (e.g., `/products/:productId`).


=== Static File Requests

This creates a trace for all static files that are served, using the path as name (e.g., `/static/image.png`).


=== Dynamic Stream Requests

This creates a trace for all dynamic content streamed from a `StreamResource`, using the resource's name (e.g., `/dynamic/[ui]/[secret]/export.csv`).


=== Navigation

This creates a nested span whenever a navigation is triggered, either from the client or the server. The span name contains the view's route template (e.g., `Navigation: /products/:productId`).

|Attribute |Description

|`vaadin.navigation.isForwardTo`
|Whether the navigation was a result of a forwarding request.

|`vaadin.navigation.route`
|The target route of the navigation.

|`vaadin.navigation.trigger`
|Whether the navigation was triggered from the client or the server.
|===


=== Browser Events

This creates a span whenever a browser event is handled by a UI, such as click events. The span name contains a descriptive label of the element that was the source of the event, as well as the event name (e.g., `Event: vaadin-button[Save] {two-colons} click`).

=== Element Synchronization

This creates a span whenever an element property has changed and is synchronized to the server. The span name contains a descriptive label for the element, as well as the property name (e.g., `Sync: vaadin-text-field[label='Customer Name'].value`).

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Attribute |Description

|`vaadin.element.property`
|The property that was synchronized.

|`vaadin.element.tag`

|===


== Spans

Each span represents a unit of work or an operation of an application. Observability Kit creates spans for Vaadin-specific operations and attaches some useful attributes and any errors that arise.


[[span-errors]]
=== Errors

The Kit records an error when the root span and any nested spans have handled an exception. If an exception is thrown, the corresponding stack trace is in the span details.

An exception may be handled and wrapped or re-thrown, which may result in several nested span levels reporting errors. In such a case, the original exception stack trace is in the details of the lowest span in the tree with an error marked against it.


[[span-attributes]]
=== Attributes

Each span has attributes associated with it. Along with https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/span-general/[the attributes that OpenTelemetry provides], Observability Kit provides Vaadin-specific attributes that can help diagnose problems with an application.


==== Global Attributes

All Vaadin-specific spans contain the `vaadin.session.id` attribute. This uniquely identifies the Vaadin session involved.


==== Request Attributes

Request spans have the following attributes:

|===
|Attribute |Description

|`http.request.file`
|For a static file request, this contains the requested file.

|`vaadin.flow.version`
|The version of Vaadin Flow that's being used (e.g., 23.1.6).

|`vaadin.request.type`
|The type of request, such as `heartbeat`, `push` or `uidl`.

|`vaadin.resolution`
|For a successful static file request, this contains "Up to date".
|===


==== Navigation Attributes

The attributes for navigation spans (e.g., `Navigate: /index`) are listed in the table here. They provide context for the cause of the navigation.

== Event Types

Components in Vaadin fire events when certain properties are changed or actions are performed. These are captured by Observability Kit instrumentation. The `vaadin.event.type` attribute can be found on the corresponding span. The attribute contains the type of event that was fired.

Here are some of the more important events:

|===
|Event |Description |Note

|change
|Fired when the user commits a change.
|

|input
|Fired when a field value is changed by the user.
|

|value-changed
|Fired when the `value` property of a component is changed. Most form components fire this event.
|The event doesn't contain the new value.

|invalid-changed
|Fired when the `invalid` property of a component is changed. Most form components fire this event.
|The event doesn't contain the new value.

|opened-changed
|Fired when the `opened` property of a component is changed. For example, a select field, accordion, or dialog.
|Check the `vaadin.state.change` attribute to see whether the component is opening or closing.

|checked-changed
|Fired when the `checked` property of a component is changed. Checkbox and radio components fire this event.
|The event doesn't contain the new value.

|selected-items-changed
|Fired when the `selectedItems` property of a component is changed. Grid, grid pro and multi select combo box components fire this event.
|The event doesn't contain the new value.
|===



== Metrics

A metric is a measurement of a service, captured at runtime. Observability Kit captures a range of JVM metrics, such as memory usage and CPU usage. It also captures Vaadin-specific metrics, including the number of open sessions and session duration.

Application and request metrics are important indicators of availability and performance. Custom metrics can provide insights into how availability indicators impact user experience.

Metrics are categorized into three types:

Counter::
A single value that only increases. An example is the number of classes loaded into the JVM.

Gauge::
A single value that's measured in intervals. The memory used by the JVM is an example of this.

Histogram::
Samples observations (e.g., individual request durations) and distributes them into buckets. Each bucket counts the number of observations that fall into a specific value range. Histograms are typically used to calculate quantiles. They also provide a total sum of all observed values and the total count of observations. This allows calculations of averages.

|Gauge
|The number of open sessions.

|`vaadin.session.duration`
