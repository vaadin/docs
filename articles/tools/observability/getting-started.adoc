= Getting Started with Observability Kit

Observability is the ability to answer questions about an application and its infrastructure. The Vaadin Observability Kit can assist in implementing this ability for Flow-based applications to obtain traceable, actionable information about applications in production.

To help you get started with Observability Kit, this page covers the following topics:

- Downloading and configuring Observability Kit to export data to the infrastructure;
- Setting up an infrastructure for collecting and viewing observability data, such as traces and metrics; and
- Running a Vaadin application with Observability Kit.



== Download & Configure

Observability Kit consists of two parts: the Starter dependency and the Agent. They're explained in these sub-sections.

[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.1"]


=== Starter Dependency

The Starter dependency can be added to your project by adding the following to the [filename]`pom.xml` file:

.`pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
  <artifactId>observability-kit-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

////
TODO ask from the dev team what to do with this section

If you're using Hilla, the starter includes a Hilla endpoint. To include and activate the endpoint, add the following configuration to your `hilla-engine-plugin`.

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
    <parser>
        <packages>
            <package>com.vaadin.hilla.observability</package>
        </packages>
    </parser>
</configuration>
----
////


=== Agent

The Agent is based on the OpenTelemetry standard and is packaged as a `.jar` file. See the <<{articles}/tools/observability/reference#,Observability Kit Reference>> documentation page for more information.

.Download the Agent JAR File
[IMPORTANT]
The Agent cannot be used as a dependency. It must be downloaded separately.

link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vaadin/observability-kit-agent/3.2.0/observability-kit-agent-3.2.0.jar[Download Observability Kit Agent, role="button secondary water"]

Once the Agent has finished downloading to the project directory, it needs to be configured to export telemetry to one or more observability tools. In this guide, traces are exported to Jaeger; metrics are sent to Prometheus. To do this, create an [filename]`agent.properties` file in the project directory with the following content:

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.adoc[tag=agent-properties]


== Setup Infrastructure

This guide uses Jaeger to process traces, and Prometheus to process metrics. They both run locally and are suitable for development and testing. For integration with other vendors, see the <<{articles}/tools/observability/integrations#,Integrations>> page.

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.adoc[tag=jaeger-setup]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.adoc[tag=prometheus-setup]

== Setup Frontend Package (Hilla)

To complete the setup process, you need to install and initialize the client-side component of the kit.

Execute the following in your terminal to install the package:

[source,terminal]
----
npm install @hilla/observability-kit-client
----

Next, open the `frontend/index.ts` file and add the following code:

[source,typescript]
----
import { init } from '@hilla/observability-kit-client';
import { ObservabilityEndpoint } from 'Frontend/generated/endpoints.js'

init(ObservabilityEndpoint.export);
----

== Run the Application

You're now ready to run your application. If you don't have one, though, you can download an application from https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start], and create a production build with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
./mvnw package -Pproduction
----

Then run the packaged JAR file from the [filename]`target` folder:

include::./integrations/_run-app.adoc[]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.adoc[tag=view-traces-metrics]
