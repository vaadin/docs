= Configuration

Instrumentation can be configured in the `agent.properties` file that is used with the Java agent.

== Service Configuration

`service` attributes are used to differentiate traces from different services / applications which might have multiple instances running at the same time (e.g. horizontally scaled services).

Service attributes are as follows:

* `service.name` is an attribute that is used to distinguish a service by name.
+
In the custom distribution this defaults to `vaadin`
* `service.namespace` helps to distinguish a group of services
* `service.instance.id` helps to distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time
+
Must be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace`, `service.name` pair
* `service.version` Semantic Versioning string of the service version

Only `service.name` has a default value as it is the only one required.

For detailed information see https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/#service[Service]

== Default OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

The custom distribution disables default OpenTelemetry instrumentation for vaadin and servlets.

The default instrumentation is disabled because a single-page Vaadin application logging all requests was not helpful and generated a lot of data, they were disabled to have control over which requests generate a trace.

The by default disabled instrumentation modules are:

* java-http-client
* jetty
* jetty-httpclient
* servlet
* tomcat

To enable any of these, add this line to the `agent.properties` file:
[source,properties]
