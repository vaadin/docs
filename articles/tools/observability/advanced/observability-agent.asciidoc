= Observability Kit Agent

The Observability Kit Agent is a custom Java agent based on the OpenTelemetry agent, with preconfigured instrumentation for Vaadin Flow applications.

[NOTE]
A Java agent is a special set of classes which, by using the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html[Java Instrumentation API], can intercept applications running on the JVM and modify their code.

https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] is a tool used to instrument applications, generate telemetry data and export it to an application performance monitoring tool.
This allows you to analyze your software's performance and behavior.

Observability Kit builds on the automatic instrumentation provided by OpenTelemetry by implementing instrumentation on Vaadin-specific classes.
This provides relevant information in the traces and improves the visibility of spans.

Instrumentation includes (but is not limited to):

- Client-server RPC handlers
- JavaScript bootstrap handler
- Session request handler
- Stream request handler
- Web component provider
- Static file server
- Vaadin service
- Vaadin session

Observability Kit also provides the following additional metrics:

- Session count
- Session duration
- UI count
