= Configuring Observability Kit

Instrumentation can be configured in the [filename]`agent.properties` file that's used with the Java agent.


== Service Configuration

The `service` attributes are used to differentiate traces from services or applications which might have many instances running simultaneously, such as horizontally scaled services.

The service attributes are as follows:

* `service.name` is an attribute that's used to distinguish a service by name. The default value is `vaadin` -- the only attribute with a default value. It's also the only one required.
* `service.namespace` helps to distinguish a group of services.
* `service.instance.id` helps to distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time. This must be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace`, `service.name` pair.
* `service.version` is the semantic versioning string of the service version.

The `service.name` attribute is configured using the `otel.service.name` property, either in the [filename]`agent.properties` configuration file as a system property, or as en environment variable.

[.example]
--

Add the following line to the [filename]`agent.properties` file:
[source,properties]
----
<source-info group="Configuration file"></source-info>
otel.service.name=myapp
----

Pass the `otel.service.name` system property when starting the Java process.
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="System property"></source-info>
java -Dotel.service.name="myapp" ...
----

Define the `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable before starting the Java process.
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="Environment variable"></source-info>
# Linux / macOS
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="myapp"
# Windows
set OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="myapp"
----

--

Other service attributes are configured using the `otel.resource.attributes` property, either in the [filename]`agent.properties` configuration file as a system property, or as en environment variable. Multiple attributes are separated by commas.

[.example]
--

Add the following line to the [filename]`agent.properties` file:
[source,properties]
----
<source-info group="Configuration file"></source-info>
otel.resource.attributes=service.namespace=myservices,service.instance.id=myapp-eu
----

Pass the `otel.resource.attributes` system property when starting the Java process.
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="System property"></source-info>
java -Dotel.resource.attributes="service.namespace=myservices,service.instance.id=myapp-eu" ...
----

Define the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable before starting the Java process.
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="Environment variable"></source-info>
# Linux / macOS
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.namespace=myservices,service.instance.id=myapp-eu"
# Windows
set OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.namespace=myservices,service.instance.id=myapp-eu"
----

For more information about service configuration, see the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/#service[OpenTelemetry documentation].


== Default OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

The custom distribution disables default OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Vaadin and servlets.

The default instrumentation is disabled because a single-page Vaadin application logging all requests wasn't helpful, although it generated plenty of data. It was disabled to have control over which requests generate a trace.

The instrumentation modules that are disabled by default are: `jetty`, `servlet`, and `tomcat`. To enable any of these, add the following line to the [filename]`agent.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
otel.instrumentation.${instrumentationName}.enabled=true
----

== Frontend Observability Configuration

:prerelease-feature: Frontend Observability
:artifact-id: observability-kit-starter
:version: 2.1-SNAPSHOT
include::{articles}/_prerelease-banner.asciidoc[opts=optional]

Frontend observability is enabled by default, with all of the client-side instrumentation active. The configuration can be tuned in two ways: statically by editing the [filename]`agent.properties` file, or by providing environment variables or system properties; or dynamically by implementing the [interfacename]`ObservabilityClientConfigurer` interface, which applies changes at runtime.

With static configuration, the same settings are applied to all UI instances. Changes to the configuration require a server restart.

With dynamic configuration, the instrumentation can be enabled or disabled at runtime, without restarting the server. The configuration can also be tuned for a specific browser tab. Changes are applied when the browser page is reloaded.

=== Frontend Observability Static Configuration

Static frontend observability configuration can be provided by adding entries to the [filename]`agent.properties` file or with environment variables or system properties, as mentioned earlier.

The following properties can be used to tune frontend instrumentation:

[cols="4,4,1"]
|===
|Property Name
|Description
|Default Value

|`otel.instrumentation.vaadin.frontend.enabled`
|Enables or disables all frontend instrumentation.
|`true`

|`otel.instrumentation.vaadin.frontend.document-load`
|Enables or disables the Document Load instrumentation.
|`true`

|`otel.instrumentation.vaadin.frontend.user-interaction`
|Enables or disables the User Interaction instrumentation.
|`true`

|`otel.instrumentation.vaadin.frontend.xml-http-request`
|Enables or disables the XML HTTP Request instrumentation.
|`true`

|`otel.instrumentation.vaadin.frontend.long-task`
|Enables or disables the Long Task instrumentation.
|`true`

|`otel.instrumentation.vaadin.frontend.frontend-error`
|Enables or disables the Frontend Error instrumentation.
|`true`

|===

For more information about the frontend instrumentation, consult the <<./reference#frontend-traces,Observability Kit Reference>> page.


=== Frontend Observability Runtime Configuration

By default, frontend observability enables all out-of-the-box client-side instrumentation. Observability Kit provides a way programmatically to enable, disable and tune the instrumentation at runtime.

This is done by implementing the [interfacename]`ObservabilityClientConfigurer` interface and applying the desired settings to the [interfacename]`ObservabilityClientConfiguration` instance provided to the [methodname]`configure` method. The configuration is applied during UI initialization: The configurator logic can access the current [classname]`VaadinRequest`. If a security infrastructure has been configured for the project and the user is logged into the application, the user details can also be accessed. This allows fine-tuning of observability to single-user granularity.

For example, the following implementation shows how to set up observability based on a mutable configuration tied to the currently logged in user.

.`UserBasedFrontendObservability.java`
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/observability/UserBasedFrontendObservability.java[tags=full-class;indent=0]
----

With the above implementation, the configuration can be fetched from a database table. This allows changes to be applied at runtime after a browser page reload.

The configurator is loaded through the Java ServiceLoader API, by adding the file [filename]`com.vaadin.observability.ObservabilityClientConfigurer` to the [filename]`src/main/resources/META-INF/services/` directory, with the content being the fully qualified name of the configurator class.

For this example, the file looks like this: `com.vaadin.observability.ObservabilityClientConfigurer`

[source]
----
org.example.UserBasedFrontendObservability
----

For details on observability client settings, consult the Javadocs of the [interfacename]`ObservabilityClientConfiguration` interface.

.Load the configurator in a Spring project.
[NOTE]
====
For Spring based projects, the configurator can be loaded by exposing the implementation as a Spring managed [annotationname]`@Bean`, without the need to register the class for the ServiceLoader API.
