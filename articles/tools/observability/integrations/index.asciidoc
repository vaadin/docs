= Observability Kit Integrations

The Observability Kit agent can be used with any vendor that natively support the https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry standard].

For others, there is the possibility to use the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry collector] with a service-specific exporter to forward the telemetry data.

We have explicitly tested and provide support for the following vendors:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Vendor |Description

|xref:newrelic#[New Relic]
|Observability SaaS platform with support for metrics, traces and logs

|xref:datadog#[Datadog]
|Observability SaaS platform with support for metrics, traces, as well as limited support for logs

|xref:grafana#[Grafana]
|Observability stack with support for metrics, traces and logs. Can be self-hosted and also provides managed hosting.

|xref:jaeger-prometheus#[Jaeger and Prometheus]
|A simple local setup that can be used for testing, with support for metrics and traces.

|===


For simple development-time testing locally, we propose using xref:jaeger-prometheus#[Jaeger and Prometheus] or xref:grafana#[Grafana]:

- Jaeger and Prometheus can be easily downloaded, and run standalone without any further dependencies.
Jaeger is used to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics.
This setup has the downside that it does not support logs, and data is viewed from two different tools.
- The Grafana setup requires Docker and docker-compose to be installed.
The setup has the benefit that it supports logs and all data is viewable from a single tool.
