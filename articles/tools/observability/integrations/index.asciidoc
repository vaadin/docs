Vaadin tests and supports the following vendors:

For other vendors, you can use the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry collector] with a service-specific exporter to forward the telemetry data.


== Local Development and Testing

For development-time testing locally, you should use Jaeger and Prometheus, or Grafana:

- Jaeger and Prometheus can be downloaded, and run stand-alone without any further dependencies. Jaeger is used to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics. This setup has the downside that it doesn't support logs, and data is viewed from two different tools.

- The Grafana setup requires Docker and `docker-compose` to be installed. This setup has the benefit that it supports logs and all data is viewable from a single tool.


== Support for Other Libraries and Frameworks

Since Observability Kit is based on the OpenTelemetry Java agent, it also includes many non-Vaadin-specific instrumentation that can be helpful in monitoring an application.

For example, it can include database requests using the JPA API, or outgoing HTTP requests.
