= Grafana Integration

Grafana is an observability stack with support for metrics, traces, and logs. It can be self-hosted, in addition to using the commercial managed hosting.


== Setup

These instructions are for a local Grafana setup which you can run using https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose].
Alternatively, Grafana provides a managed hosting service for their products.

.Not Production-Ready
[CAUTION]
This setup is intended for local testing, only. It isn't production ready. See the Grafana documentation on how to https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/[configure and secure a self-hosted setup].

Start by cloning the https://github.com/vaadin/observability-grafana-setup[`observability-grafana-setup`] repository:

[source,terminal]
git clone https://github.com/vaadin/observability-grafana-setup.git

From the setup folder, run:

[source,terminal]
----
cd observability-grafana-setup
docker-compose up
----

This command starts a set of services for collecting and displaying data from Observability Kit:

- *Grafana Tempo* for collecting and storing traces;
- *Prometheus* for collecting and storing metrics;
- *Grafana Loki* for collecting and storing logs;
- *OpenTelemetry collector* for ingesting telemetry data from the agent, and distributing it to the services above; and
- *Grafana* for displaying traces, metrics and logs, also from the services above.


[[configuration-file]]
== Observability Kit Configuration

To configure Observability Kit, create an [filename]`agent.properties` file with the following content:

.agent.properties
[source,properties]
----
otel.service.name=vaadin
otel.traces.exporter=otlp
otel.metrics.exporter=otlp
otel.logs.exporter=otlp
----

In the configuration above, the service name is defined as `vaadin`, which is also the default of the agent. The service name can be customized. Notice that the pre-configured Grafana dashboard queries data from the `vaadin` service, and needs to be edited when using a custom service name.

By default, the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) exporters assume that the OpenTelemetry collector is running locally. You don't need to configure endpoints. If the collector is running on a different system, you need to configure an endpoint for the exporter:

.agent.properties
[source,properties]
----
otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=https://collector.my-domain.net:4317
----


== Running the Application

include::./_run-app.adoc[]


== Viewing Data

The Grafana setup provides a http://localhost:3000/d/6_bNYpGVz/vaadin-dashboard?orgId=1[sample dashboard] that shows basic metrics, like JVM memory usage and CPU usage, traces and errors, as well as logs. To log in, use the default credentials `admin` and `admin`.

.Configure Service Name
[NOTE]
The service name needs to be configured as `vaadin` in the <<configuration-file,configuration  file>>. Otherwise, the dashboard doesn't show any data.

The individual panels of the dashboard may be used to explore the data in more detail. Click on a panel's name to open the drop-down menu, and then click on [guilabel]*Explore*.

See the https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/[Grafana documentation] for more information on how to use the http://localhost:3000/explore[Explore view].


=== Viewing Traces

To view traces, open the http://localhost:3000/explore[Explore view], and select [guilabel]*Tempo* as the data source. Change the [guilabel]*Query type* to [guilabel]*Search*, and select the name of the service from the [guilabel]*Service name* menu. Then click the refresh button in the top-right to search for traces.

Use the [guilabel]*Tags* option to filter for specific span attributes. For example, to filter for traces that contains errors, enter `error=true`.

Clicking on a trace ID brings up a side panel that shows detailed information about a specific trace, such as nested spans, and their attributes and events.


=== Viewing Metrics

To view metrics, open the http://localhost:3000/explore[Explore view], and select [guilabel]*Prometheus* as the data source. Select a metric from the [guilabel]*Metric* drop-down, for example, [guilabel]*process_runtime_jvm_memory_usage* to view JVM memory usage. Then click the refresh button in the top-right display the metric.


=== Viewing Logs

To view logs, open the http://localhost:3000/explore[Explore view], and select [guilabel]*Loki* as data source. Under [guilabel]*Labels*, configure a label for `service_name`, with the value that's defined as service name in the <<configuration-file,configuration file>>: `vaadin` by default. Then click the refresh button in the top-right to search for logs.
