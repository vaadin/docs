= Vaadin Observability Integrations

Vaadin Observability Agent can be used with any vendors who natively support OpenTelemetry.

For others, there is the possibility to use OpenTelemetry collector with a service-specific exporter to forward the telemetry data.

For simple development-time testing locally, we propose using xref:jaeger-prometheus#[Jaeger and Prometheus].
Where Jaeger is used to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics.
