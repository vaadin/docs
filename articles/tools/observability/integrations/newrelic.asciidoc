= New Relic Integration

https://newrelic.com[New Relic] supports the export of metrics, traces and logs.

== Sign Up for a New Relic Account

A New Relic account can be created from https://newrelic.com/signup[here].
There is no cost for exporting up to 100GB of data per month.

== Limitations

New Relic will ignore all messages above a certain size.
To avoid losing data, messages can be automatically truncated using the property `otel.attribute.value.length.limit` (see below).

== Create Agent Properties File

Create a new properties file named `agent.properties` and add the following lines to it:

.`*agent.properties*`
[source,properties]
----
otel.traces.exporter=otlp
otel.logs.exporter=otlp
otel.metrics.exporter=otlp
otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=ENDPOINT_URL
otel.exporter.otlp.headers=Api-Key=LICENSE_KEY
otel.exporter.otlp.protocol=http/protobuf
otel.attribute.value.length.limit=4095
otel.instrumentation.runtime-metrics.enabled=true
----

[NOTE]
The `ENDPOINT_URL` can be found from the table in the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/#review-settings[New Relic documentation].

[NOTE]
The `LICENSE_KEY` can be found in your New Relic account settings under `API Keys`.
Be sure to use the license key of type `INGEST-LICENSE`.


== Running the App

include::./_run-app.asciidoc[opts=optional]

== Reading Telemetry Data

After using the application for a while (the traces will show up with a delay) log in to New Relic.

From the view `All entities`, select under `Services - OpenTelemetry` your service name (`vaadin` if you didn't specify your own).

Now you will have a menu where you can look through the telemetry data from you application.
