= Running the Demo Application

With the telemetry exports set up, we can now run the demo application with the Observability Kit agent.

For this tutorial, we are using a runnable jar file (see <<getting-started#,Getting Started>>).

Open a terminal or command prompt to the same folder as the jar for the demo application and enter the following:

[source,Shell]
----
java -javaagent:PATH/TO/vaadin-opentelemetry-javaagent-VERSION.jar -Dotel.javaagent.configuration-file=PATH/TO/agent.properties -jar observability-demo.jar
----

[NOTE]
Remember to substitute the correct path to the `agent.properties` file and the correct path and version of the Observability Kit agent JAR.
