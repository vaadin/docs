= Setup Export to New Relic

New Relic supports the export of metrics, traces and logs.

== Sign Up for a New Relic Account

A New Relic account can be created from https://newrelic.com/signup[here].
There is no cost for exporting up to 100GB of data per month.

== Create Agent Properties File

Create a new properties file named `agent.properties` and add the following lines to it:

.`*agent.properties*`
[source,properties]
----
otel.metrics.exporter=otlp
otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=ENDPOINT_URL
otel.exporter.otlp.headers=Api-Key=LICENSE_KEY
otel.exporter.otlp.protocol=http/protobuf
----

[NOTE]
The `ENDPOINT_URL` can be found from the table in the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/#review-settings[New Relic documentation]. The `LICENSE_KEY` can be found in your New Relic account settings under `API Keys`. Be sure to use the license key of type `INGEST-LICENSE`.

== Run the Application

Add the following option to the Java options for your container and then restart it:

----
-Dotel.javaagent.configuration-file=PATH/TO/agent.properties -javaagent:PATH/TO/vaadin-opentelemetry-javaagent-VERSION.jar
----

[NOTE]
The method for setting these options varies for each container.
We have provided instructions for some of the more popular products: <<../containers#,Containers>>.
