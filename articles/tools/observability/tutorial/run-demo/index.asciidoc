= Running the Demo Application

With the telemetry exports set up, we can now run the demo application with the Vaadin Observability agent.

For this tutorial, we are using a Maven build target to run the application.
We have also provided instructions for running an application packaged as a runnable JAR file or deployed to a servlet container.
