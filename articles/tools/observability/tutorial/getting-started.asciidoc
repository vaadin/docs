= Getting Started With Observability Kit

The Kit is planned to be used with your own application, and it is recommended to run the application as a production build.


== Download the Demo

If you do not have a specific application the exists a demo application to use.
This is also mentioned throughout this tutorial in order to demonstrate the features of Observability Kit.

Clone the demo application from https://gitlab.vaadin.com/mgrankvi/observable-app.git

== Download the Observability Kit Agent

Observability Kit is packaged as a Java agent based on the OpenTelemetry agent.
For more information, see <<../advanced/observability-agent#,Observability Kit Agent>>.

Click on the following button to get the latest release agent from Assets (jar file):

https://github.com/vaadin/observability/releases[Download agent,role="button secondary water"]

[NOTE]
For simplicity save/copy the jar to the application directory.

== Setup Telemetry Export

For this tutorial, we are using Jaeger to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics.
These are both run locally and are suitable for development and testing.

Note the demo application contains `jaeger.properties` and `jaeger.[sh|bat]` files that target the default ports.
