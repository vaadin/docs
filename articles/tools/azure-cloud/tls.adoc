= TLS

To help using `letsencrypt` there is an option in Terraform variables to enable `letsencrypt` `certmanager` in the cluster.

After `certmanager` is installed you still need to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/ingress-tls?tabs=azure-cli#create-a-ca-cluster-issuer[create the cluster issuer].

After this, the next steps are to configure your ingress to use these certificates. You can follow the same Microsoft https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/ingress-tls?tabs=azure-cli#update-your-ingress-routes[guide] for this.

If you plan to use normal certificates it's best to follow these https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-nginx-tls[steps] by Microsoft.
