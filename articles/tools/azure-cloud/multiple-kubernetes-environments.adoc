= Multiple Kubernetes Environments

When deploying multiple Kubernetes environments -- for example, for staging and production -- the best approach is to use separate directories for each environment. Then you can modify the [filename]`variables.tf` file for each.

Each combination of application, environment and location variables would result in a different environment.

It's also possible to have multiple subscriptions, and to set most of the Terraform variables the same. With multiple subscriptions, though, the `storageaccounts` cannot have the same name.
