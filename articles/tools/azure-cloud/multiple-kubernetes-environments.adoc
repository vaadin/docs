= Multiple Kubernetes Environments

When deploying multiple Kubernetes environments (e.g., for staging and production), the best approach is to use separate directories for each environment.
Then you can modify the [filename]`variables.tf` file for each environment.

Each combination of application, environment and location variables would result in a different environment.

It's also possible to have multiple subscriptions and set most of the Terraform variables the same.
With multiple subscriptions, though, the `storageaccounts` cannot have the same name.
