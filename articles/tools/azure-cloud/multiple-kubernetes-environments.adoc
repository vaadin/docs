= Multiple Kubernetes Environments (Staging/Prod)

The best approach when deploying multiple Kubernetes environments is to use separate directories for each environment.
Then you can modify the [filename]`variables.tf` file for each environment.

Each combination of application, environment and location variables would result in a different environment.

It's also possible to have multiple subscriptions and keep most of the Terraform variables to be same.
With multiple subscriptions the `storageaccounts` cannot have the same name.
