= Licensing Model

Collaboration Kit is licensed under the https://vaadin.com/commercial-license-and-service-terms[Vaadin Runtime License]. You can try Collaboration Kit and use it to develop applications without charge. When your application goes to production, though, you'll need a valid license.

While your application is in development mode, you can use all of the features of Collaboration Kit without any restrictions. You don't need a development license or a separate trial. Development mode is the default mode of a Vaadin application and is used when not configured explicitly for a production build.

To get started, follow the <<tutorial#,Quick Start Guide's instructions>> to add Collaboration Kit to your Vaadin application, and to use its high-level APIs.


[[ce.developing.billing-model]]
== Billing Model

Collaboration Kit is billed at runtime, based on the number of unique users per month using collaboration features in an application. See the https://vaadin.com/pricing[pricing page] for the number of monthly end-users allowed under the free tier.

To move an application using Collaboration Kit into production, there are two options: a free _universal_ license; or a commercial license. Each is described below.


[[ce.developing.free-universal-license]]
== Free Universal License

The universal license allows any developer to use the Collaboration Kit for free. It allows a limited number of unique users each month in a Vaadin application to use features that rely on Collaboration Kit. Developers aren't required to have a commercial Vaadin subscription to use the universal license.

See the https://vaadin.com/pricing[pricing page] for the number of monthly end-users allowed under the free tier.

To download the universal license, click on the <<going-to-production#, Production Configuration>> link in the margin, and look for the <<going-to-production#ce.production.obtain-universal-license, Free Universal License File>> section.


[[ce.developing.paid-commercial-license]]
== Commercial License

A commercial license requires an active https://vaadin.com/pricing[commercial Vaadin subscription]. The commercial license allows an unlimited number of end-users to use Collaboration Kit features.

If you already have a commercial Vaadin subscription, https://vaadin.com/collaboration#contact-us[contact Vaadin to request a license]. Otherwise, visit the https://vaadin.com/pricing[pricing page] to buy a commercial Vaadin subscription.
