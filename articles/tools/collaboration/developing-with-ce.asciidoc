= Licensing & Pricing Model

Collaboration Kit is licensed under the https://vaadin.com/license/cvrl-1.0[Commercial Vaadin Runtime License (CVRL)]. You can try Collaboration Kit and use it to develop applications without charge. When your application goes to production, though, you'll need a valid license file.

While your application is in development mode, you can use all of the features of Collaboration Kit without restrictions. You don't need a development license or a separate trial. Development mode is the default mode of a Vaadin application and is used when not configured explicitly for a production build.

To get started, follow the <<tutorial#,Quick Start Guide>> to learn about adding Collaboration Kit to your Vaadin application, and using its high-level APIs.


[[ce.developing.pricing-model]]
== Billing Model

Collaboration Kit is billed at runtime, based on the number of unique users per month using collaboration features in an application. Up to 50 users is free of charge.

To move an application using Collaboration Kit into production, there are two options: a free _universal_ license; or a commercial license.


[[ce.developing.free-universal-license]]
== Free Universal License

The universal license is free for all Vaadin developers. It allows up to 50 unique users each month in a Vaadin application to use features that rely on Collaboration Kit. Developers aren't require to have a commercial Vaadin subscription -- not Pro, Prime, or Ultimate -- to use the universal license.

To download the universal license, go to <<going-to-production#ce.production.obtain-universal-license, "Free Universal License File">>.


[[ce.developing.paid-commercial-license]]
== Commercial License

A commercial license requires an active commercial Vaadin subscription (i.e., Pro, Prime, or Enterprise). Each commercial Vaadin subscription is entitled to a bundled quota of users:

- Pro subscribers get 50 bundled users per month.
- Prime subscribers get 150 bundled users per month.
- Enterprise subscribers can negotiate a custom quota.

A https://vaadin.com/collaboration#pricing[starting package] of 500 users per month can be purchased without the need of another commercial subscription. Custom bundles are also possible.

If you already have a commercial Vaadin subscription, https://vaadin.com/collaboration#contact-us[contact Vaadin to request a license]. Otherwise, visit the https://vaadin.com/pricing[pricing page] to buy a commercial Vaadin subscription.
