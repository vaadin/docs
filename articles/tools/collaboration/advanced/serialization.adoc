= Kubernetes Kit Session Replication

<<{articles}/tools/kubernetes#,Kubernetes Kit>> allows session replication by transferring HTTP session data via a backend session storage for every request. This requires that everything stored in the session is made serializable. The Kubernetes Kit documentation provides some general <<{articles}/tools/kubernetes/session-replication#session-replication-tips,session replication tips>>. However, when using Collaboration Kit, there are some specific changes you may need to make.


== Collaboration Kit Classes

An instance of the  class `CollaborationEngine` should not be stored in the session. Don't work directly with the `CollaborationEngine` class. Instead, utilize other APIs, such as <<{articles}/tools/collaboration/advanced/topic-api#,`Topic`>>, <<{articles}/tools/collaboration/components/collaboration-binder#,`CollaborationBinder`>> and the <<{articles}/tools/collaboration/managers/index#,managers>>. If you must work directly with the class, it should always be accessed using its singleton method:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/collaboration/ConnectionContextExample.java[tags=component-context,indent=0]
----

[NOTE]
The `MessageManager` constructor now takes a static method reference as its last argument. Previously, this took an instance of `CollaborationEngine`. This version of the constructor has now been deprecated, so you should also update this in your code.

Here is a list of other Collaboration Kit classes that should not be stored in the session:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Class |Alternative

|`CollaborationList` |Use `topic.getNamedList()`
|`CollaborationMap` |Use `topic.getNamedMap()`
|`TopicConnection` |Use `CollaborationEngine.getInstance().openTopicConnection()`
|===

Conversely, here is a list of Collaboration Kit classes that are serializable and can be stored in the session:

|===
|Class

|`CollaborationAvatarGroup`
|`CollaborationBinder`
|`CollaborationMessage`
|`CollaborationMessageInput`
|`CollaborationMessageList`
|`ComponentConnectionContext`
|`FormManager`
|`MessageManager`
|`PresenceManager`
|`SystemConnectionContext`
|===
