= Obtaining a Collaboration Kit Instance in a Servlet

When a [classname]`VaadinService` instance isn't available, it's impossible to obtain a [classname]`CollaborationEngine` instance with the [methodname]`getInstance()` method.
In a servlet, the instance can be obtained with the [methodname]`getAttribute()` method, as long as it has been configured.
See the <<{articles}/tools/ce/going-to-production#other-applications, Other Applications>> in production configuration documentation for details on how to configure Collaboration Kit.
