= Handle Form Values and Field Highlighting with Your Own Logic

Collaboration Kit includes a manager to set property values and field highlighting in a form, and to react to changes in these.
It provides a simple way to create a custom form component with collaborative features.

The manager can also be used in conjunction with a [classname]`CollaborationBinder` (<<../components/collaboration-binder#,Collaborative Form Editing>>) connected to the same topic.
Any changes made to property values or highlighting via the [classname]`FormManager` are reflected in any fields bound to the same properties, and vice versa.

<1> Creating a [classname]`FormManager` takes:
- a component to bind the manager connection context to the UI,
- an instance of [classname]`UserInfo` that represents the current local user, and
- the ID of the topic to connect to.

<2> The [methodname]`highlight()` method is used to mark the local user as editing a property.
_Any field component bound to the same property via a [classname]`CollaborationBinder` connected to the same topic is highlighted and shows the name of the user._

<3> The [methodname]`setHighlightHandler()` method sets a callback to handle a user editing a property.
The property name and the `UserInfo` of the user are provided by the context passed as the argument to the callback.
_This can be used, for example, to focus a field component._

<4> The callback returns another callback, a [classname]`Registration`, that's called when the same user stops editing a property.

<5> The [methodname]`setValue()` method is used to set the value of a property.
_The value is set on all field components bound to the same property via a [classname]`CollaborationBinder` instance connected to the same topic._

<6> The [methodname]`setPropertyChangeHandler()` method sets a callback to handle a property value changing.
The property name and the new value are provided by the event passed as the argument to the callback.
