= Handle User Presence

Collaboration Kit includes a manager to set the user presence in a topic, keep track of users who are present, and react to changes in the presence. It provides a simple and flexible way to manage topic data related to user presence, and makes it easy to create custom components with collaborative features.

The following example has a custom component that shows the list of active users in a topic using the presence manager:

<1> Creating a [classname]`PresenceManager` takes a component to bind the manager connection context to the UI, an instance of [classname]`UserInfo` that represents the current local user, and the topic identifier on which to connect.

<2> The [methodname]`markAsPresent()` method is used to configure the manager to mark the local user as present in the topic as soon as a connection is established.

<3> The [methodname]`setPresenceHandler` method sets a callback to handle a new user joining the topic. The [classname]`UserInfo` for the new user is provided by the context passed as the argument to the callback.

<4> The callback returns another callback, a registration, that's called to remove the same user when the user leaves the topic.
