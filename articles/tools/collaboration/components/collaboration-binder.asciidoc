= Collaborative Form Editing

The recommended way of binding data from Java beans to forms in Vaadin applications is to use `Binder`
(read <<{articles}/binding-data/components-binder#,Binding Data to Forms>> to learn more).
Collaboration Kit provides a `Binder` extension called `CollaborationBinder`,
which adds the following real-time features on top of the binder's data binding and validation APIs:

- Field value synchronization: When a user enters a new value to a field, the value is updated for the other users as well.
- Field highlight: When a user is focused on a field, other users see a highlight around the field and a user name indicating who is currently editing it.

== Constructing a CollaborationBinder

The constructor of `CollaborationBinder` requires the bean type to bind values to,
similarly to the regular `Binder` when binding by property names.
As the second argument, you must provide some information about the end user.
The same `UserInfo` object is required by all Collaboration Kit features.
`CollaborationBinder` uses the name in `UserInfo`, when indicating
that another user is editing a field with the field highlight.

== Connecting to Collaboration Kit and Populating the Form

The `CollaborationBinder::setTopic` method serves two purposes:

1. Connecting to Collaboration Kit in the scope of the edited item
2. Populating the form with initial values loaded from a backend

Here is an example use case. When selecting an item to edit (an instance of `Person` bean class in this case),
`setTopic` is used to connect to the topic and to populate the form:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/collaboration/BinderDocumentation.java[tags=binder-topic,indent=0]
----

The first parameter is the id of the topic to connect to.
Using unique topic ids for different items makes sure that edits on different items don't interfere with each other.

The second parameter is a callback for providing the bean that populates the fields.
The regular `Binder` has the `readBean` method for populating the fields based on bean properties.
This method isn't supported by `CollaborationBinder`. The reason is, that calling `readBean`
when a new view instance is constructed would have an unwanted effect:
Every time a new user would join editing the form, the field values would reset for every user.
The `setBean` method is unsupported for the same reason.

The callback provided for `setTopic` replaces `readBean`.
It's used to populate the form if the topic doesn't have any data yet,
which means that the user is the first one to edit that form.
Otherwise, the field values are loaded from the topic in Collaboration Kit.
In this case, the callback isn't even called, possibly avoiding an unnecessary database request.

NOTE: If you explicitly want to override all field values for all collaborators (for example implement a reset button),
you can use `CollaborationBinder::reset` method, which takes a bean instance and uses its properties for
setting the field values.


== Binding Collaborative Fields

This example shows how you can bind the `Person` bean's `name` property to a text field, enabling also the collaborative features (value synchronization and field highlight):

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/collaboration/BinderDocumentation.java[tags=binder-bind,indent=0]
----

You could write exactly the same code with the regular `Binder`.
`CollaborationBinder` adds the collaborative features on top of the regular data binding.
Binding based on a property name ("name" in this case) requires the bean class (`Person`)
to have standard getter and setter methods `getName` and `setName`.

The other `bind` variant, which takes the getter and setter callbacks as arguments, isn't supported by `CollaborationBinder`.
The technical reason for this is, that some unique key is needed
per each field/property to store the data in the underlying `CollaborationMap` data structure.
The property name is required for that purpose, to be used as the key.

Because the data used to communicate with Collaboration Kit is serialized as JSON, there are some limitations
to what `CollaborationBinder` can do automatically.
To cover the special cases, you need to do a little bit more than bind a property to a field.


=== Non-Primitive Value Types

Collaboration Kit supports only a limited set of primitive-like value types, that it knows how to serialize and deserialize.
When using some other field value type, you must explicitly provide the serializer and deserializer functions.

When the field is used for selecting a bean object that has a unique identifier, you can serialize the value by converting the bean to its identifier, and deserialize by fetching the bean object that matches the id.

In this example, the `Person` bean a user edits, has a reference to the person's supervisor, which is another `Person`.
Use a `ComboBox` component for selecting the person's supervisor:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/collaboration/BinderDocumentation.java[tags=binder-serializer,indent=0]
----

The person ids are stored as `longs` in this case, and the serialized value needs to be a `String`.
In this case, you need to do a bit of converting between strings and longs.


=== Converters

When a `Converter` is used, you must provide the field's value type in `forField`.

This example binds an enum property of the bean to a `Checkbox`, so the value type `boolean` needs to be provided:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/collaboration/BinderDocumentation.java[tags=binder-converter,indent=0]
----

This is necessary, because `CollaborationBinder` uses the bean
property type (`MaritalStatus` enum in this case) for deserializing
the field value by default.


=== Multi Select Fields

When the field's value type is a collection,
you must provide the type of the collection as well as the
type of its contents in `forField`.

For example, the value type of `CheckboxGroup` is `Set`.
In the following example, you must provide the collection type `Set` and the content type `String`.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/collaboration/BinderDocumentation.java[tags=binder-bind,indent=0]
----

This is necessary, because `CollaborationBinder` can't automatically infer the
generic type for deserializing the value.
If the element type isn't supported by Collaboration Kit (for example `CheckboxGroup<Person>`),
you need to implement custom (de)serializer functions anyway.

== Propagate Values Eagerly in Text Fields
On text fields, the default and recommended mode for propagating values from one user to others is when the user blurs the field or presses the enter key.
You can configure how eagerly the field sends data through its own API, using the `setValueChangeMode(ValueChangeMode)` method.

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Weasel = YES -->]
For example, to instantly send each keystroke to other users, you would do the following:

[source,java]
----
TextField textField = new TextField();
textField.setValueChangeMode(ValueChangeMode.EAGER);
----

Modes like `ValueChangeMode.LAZY` and `ValueChangeMode.TIMEOUT` can also be used together with the `setValueChangeTimeout(int)` method to reduce the amount of traffic.


== Resetting Fields When There Are No Editors

By default, the edited field values are stored in Collaboration Kit indefinitely.
Even after a long time has passed since someone has visited a form and you open the form again,
you're presented with the field values that the previous user might have left there.
In this scenario, you might want the field values to be re-populated from the backend instead.

This can be achieved by setting an _expiration timeout_ on the binder.
If there hasn't been any connected users for the set period of time,
binder calls the bean supplier callback (provided in `setTopic`)
again to populate the fields.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/collaboration/BinderDocumentation.java[tags=binder-expiration-timeout,indent=0]
----

You can use `Duration.ZERO` to reset the fields immediately when there's a moment
with no connected users.
However, it might be a good idea to have a small time window.
This enables, for example, a user to recover from a temporary network issue
without having to start over with the form editing.
