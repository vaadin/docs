= Step 3 - Running a Spring Boot application with MPR and Flow

[NOTE]
This step is needed in case your Vaadin 7 or 8 application uses Spring Boot. If it is not the case, go back to the <<3-legacy-uis#,framework selection>>.

== Updating to the correct Spring version

Update parent `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-parent` to `2.1.7.RELEASE` or newer.

The dependency `com.vaadin:vaadin-spring-boot-starter` should not have a version defined as it comes from `vaadin-bom`.

[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.6.RELEASE</version>
</parent>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
Also take a look at the <<{articles}/flow/integrations/spring/spring-boot#,Using Vaadin with Spring Boot>> tutorial on how Flow integrates with Spring.

== Handling of SpringUI

The `@SpringUI` can be replaced with a `@Route`. For example this UI:

[source,java]
----
@SpringUI
@Theme("valo")
public class TodoUI extends UI {
    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest vaadinRequest) {
        setContent(new HorizontalLayout());
    }
}
----

Can be replaced with:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class TodoUI extends Div implements HasLegacyComponents {
    @PostConstruct
    private void buildLayouts() {
        setSizeFull();
        add(new HorizontalLayout());
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
Annotations in the UI, such as `@Theme` and `@Title` and so on, will be dealt with later on in the tutorial.
Most of them have similar counterpart in either Flow or MPR.

== Update imports

Then any `com.vaadin.spring.annotation` imports needs to be changed to `com.vaadin.flow.spring.annotation`.

[NOTE]
The V14 Spring add-on doesn't have a feature comparable with `ViewScope`

== What to do with SpringView

Any `@SpringView` should be updated to a Flow Route by wrapping them as a `MprRouteAdapter<? extends View>`
or re-writing it to be a Flow Component. See <<3-navigator#no-navigator,Upgrading Views to Flow Routes>> for details.

The easiest way to migrate Spring views is to use Flow `@Route` navigation target 
component which wraps the view via `MprRouteAdapter<? extends View>`. There is no 
need to annotate Flow navigation target or `View` anyhow.
Starting from Vaadin 21 `@RouteScope`  without `@RouteScopeOwner` annotation can
be used as a replacement for `@ViewScope`. The bean within `@RouteScope` 
(without specified `@RouteScopeOwner`) stays preserved until the current 
navigation target/view is active (attached). It's possible to use `@RouteScopeOwner` 
of course explicitly but that requires one extra line.

The following is an example of using `@RouteScope`:

[source,java]
----
@Route("help")
public class HelpRoute extends MprRouteAdapter<HelpView>  {
}

public class HelpView extends VerticalLayout implements View {

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext context;

    @Override
    public void enter(ViewChangeEvent event) {
       HelpService service = context.getBean(HelpService.class);
       // every time when {@code context.getBean(HelpService.class)} called 
       // the HelpService instance is the same until we are inside HelpView/HelpRoute
       Label label = new Label(service.getHelp());
       addComponent(label);       
    }
}

@RouteScope
public class HelpService {

    public String getHelp(){
        return "some help";
    }
}

----

== Things to keep in mind
* When porting the UI to a flow component, you lose the ability to use UI methods, such as `setErrorHandler`. You can still access those
by using `UI.getCurrent()`. The method `setContent` is not supported though - you should use the `add` method from your Flow layout instead.

* When running MPR with Spring, the Spring integration is done with Flow (and not anymore with Vaadin 7 or 8), so in some cases you will need to
import classes from the old `vaadin-spring` project in order to make your MPR project to compile,
since those classes are not present anymore in the new versions of `vaadin-spring`.
The source code of `vaadin-spring` can be found on https://github.com/vaadin/spring[GitHub]. Examples of such classes:

** com.vaadin.spring.access.SecuredViewAccessControl;
** com.vaadin.spring.access.ViewAccessControl;
** com.vaadin.spring.internal.SpringBeanUtil;
** com.vaadin.spring.internal.VaadinSpringComponentFactory;
** com.vaadin.spring.server.SpringVaadinServletService;

* If your routes are defined in a different package than the Spring application itself, you need to annotate your application with `@EnableVaadin`,
in order to Spring to scan the appropriate folders for beans. For example:

[source,java]
----
// Assuming that Application is in a different package than the classes
// annotated with @Route
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableVaadin("com.mycompany.views")
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
----
