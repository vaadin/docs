= Step by Step Guide

This document will guide you through a series of steps to properly upgrade a working Vaadin 7 or Vaadin 8 application to Vaadin Flow.

[NOTE]
It is easier to get started by changing things inside the existing Vaadin application than starting from a Flow Starter.

== Step 1 - pom.xml configuration

The first step is to configure the Maven dependencies and plugins for MPR to work properly. There are different settings depending on which Vaadin version you use:

* My application uses <<1-maven-v7#,Vaadin 7 -> >>
* My application uses <<1-maven-v8#,Vaadin 8 -> >>
