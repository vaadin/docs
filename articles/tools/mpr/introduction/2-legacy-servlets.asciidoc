= Step 2 - Removing Legacy Servlets

The MPR framework manages the VaadinServlets to make sure the correct requests are
routed to the right frameworks (either Flow or Vaadin 7/8). For that to work properly,
all legacy VaadinServlets need to be removed. If you need some custom functionality,
you can use the VaadinServlet provided by Flow instead.

See <<{articles}/flow/advanced/dynamic-content#using-custom-servlet-and-request-parameters,Flow documentation on Dynamic content>>
for details.
