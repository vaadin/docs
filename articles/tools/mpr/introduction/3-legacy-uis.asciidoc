= Converting Legacy UIs

The UI object -- which represents the `<body>` element in the page -- is controlled by Flow when running the MPR. As a result, anything extending `UI` should be converted. Actually, `UI` class shouldn't be used for layout or navigation handling. At the end of this part of the process, you shouldn't have any `UI` class -- unless you have a real use case for it.

Depending on what's used in the project, you have several conversion paths:

- Application uses <<3-spring-boot#,Spring Boot>>
- Application uses <<3-cdi#,CDI>>
- Application uses <<3-navigator#,Navigator>>
- Application doesn't use any of those.

Continue to <<3-no-framework#,Converting a UI>>.
