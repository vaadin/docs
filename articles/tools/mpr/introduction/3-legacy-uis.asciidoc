= Step 3 - Converting Legacy UIs

The UI object, which represents the `<body>` element in the page, is controlled by Flow when running the MPR,
so anything extending `UI` should be converted. Actually, `UI` class shouldn't be
used for layout or navigation handling anymore. At the end of step 3, you
shouldn't have any `UI` class unless you have a real use case for it.

Depending on what's used in the project, you have several conversion paths:

// TODO Allow for now, should rewrite the list
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.FirstPerson = NO -->]

* My application uses <<3-spring-boot#,Spring Boot -> >>
* My application uses <<3-cdi#,CDI -> >>
* My application uses <<3-navigator#,Navigator -> >>
* My application doesn't use any of those. Continue to <<3-no-framework#,Converting a UI -> >>
