= Adding Legacy Components to Flow layouts

At this stage, you have everything you need to make a Vaadin 7 or 8 application to
run inside a Flow application. Since this is a Flow application, you can add Flow components to the layout alongside the legacy components. You can also create legacy components and add them, dynamically. Below is an example of this:

[source,java]
----
add(new com.vaadin.flow.component.html.NativeButton(
        "Flow button that adds a FW7 Label", e -> {
            add(new LegacyWrapper(
                    new com.vaadin.ui.Label("Legacy label")));
        }));
add(new LegacyWrapper(new com.vaadin.ui.NativeButton(
        "Legacy button that adds a Flow Label", e -> {
            add(new com.vaadin.flow.component.html.Label("Flow label"));
        })));
----

Fully qualified names were used in this example to make it clear which class comes from which framework.

See the <<../configuration/adding-legacy-components#,Adding Legacy Components in a Flow Layout>> tutorial for more details.


== Adding New Views

New views added to the application should follow Flow's routing system. In Flow, "Views" are called "RouteTargets" and are managed primarily by the `@Route` annotation. For details on the differences in navigation between Flow and previous Vaadin versions, see the <<{articles}/upgrading#,Upgrading Guide>>.

For more information about Flow's navigation mechanism, see <<{articles}/routing#,Routing and Navigation>>.


== Production Mode

After your application is built and it's running with MPR, you should consider packaging it for production. See the <<../configuration/production-mode#,Setting Up Production Mode>> tutorial for details.
