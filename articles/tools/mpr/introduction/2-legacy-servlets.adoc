= Removing Legacy Servlets

The MPR framework manages the VaadinServlets to make sure the correct requests are routed to the right frameworks -- either Flow or Vaadin 7/8. For that to work, all legacy VaadinServlets have to be removed. If you need some custom functionality, you can use the VaadinServlet provided by Flow instead.
