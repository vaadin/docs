= Removing Legacy Servlets

The MPR framework manages the VaadinServlets to make sure the correct requests are routed to the right frameworks -- either Flow or Vaadin 7/8. For that to work, all legacy VaadinServlets have to be removed. If you need some custom functionality, you can use the VaadinServlet provided by Flow instead.

See <<{articles}/flow/advanced/dynamic-content#using-custom-servlet-and-request-parameters,Flow documentation on Dynamic content>> for details.

The next step is <<3-legacy-uis#,Converting legacy UIs>>.
