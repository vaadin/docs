= Step 4 - Converting UI parameters

For this step, not all actions need to be done. It depends on what is configured in your original UI.

Please refer to each specific tutorial for details.

* My application uses a <<../configuration/legacy-widgetset#,custom widgetset -> >>
* My application uses a <<../configuration/legacy-theme#,custom theme -> >>
* My application uses <<../configuration/push#,push -> >>
* My application needs to manage the <<../configuration/session#,VaadinSessions -> >>
* My application uses an advanced <<../configuration/custom-ui#,custom UI logic -> >>

== Other parameters

* For `@Title`, you should use `@PageTitle` from the `com.vaadin.flow.router` package;
* For `@Viewport`, you should use `@ViewPort` from the `com.vaadin.flow.component.page` package.

After converting those parameters, you can progress to the next step.
