= Custom Widget Set & MPR

By default, there is no need for a custom widget-set. MPR functions using the `AppWidgetset` are automatically built and configured by scanning the dependencies.

When using MPR, you can't use Content Delivery Network (CDN) for the widget-set. The configuration `<vaadin.widgetset.mode>cdn</vaadin.widgetset.mode>` should be removed.

To use a custom widget-set for the legacy framework embedded with MPR, add `MprWidgetset` annotation to your `AppShellConfigurator` configuration class.

.Widget Set Definition
[source,java]
----
@MprWidgetset("com.vaadin.mpr.DemoWidgetset")
public class Configuration implements AppShellConfigurator {
}

public class MainLayout extends Div implements RouterLayout {
}

@Route(value = "", layout = MainLayout.class)
public class RootTarget extends Div {
    public RootTarget() {
      LegacyWrapper addressbookWrapper = new LegacyWrapper(
                  new AddressbookLayout());
      add(addressbookWrapper);
    }
}

The `AppWidgetset` contains widget-sets found by scanning the dependencies, but at times you might only want to have specific widget-sets included or you'll need an optimized widget-set with eager and lazy parts.

For more information on the `AppWidgetset` and widget-set compilation, see
link:/docs/v7/framework/addons/addons-overview#installing[Add-ons,role="skip-xref-check"] and Widget Set part of link:/docs/v7/framework/application/application-environment[application environment,role="skip-xref-check"].

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Versions = NO -->]

[NOTE]
Although you can use Java 17 or 21 in your application code, the custom widget-set code is restricted either to Java 8 with Vaadin 7 or to Java 11 with Vaadin 8. Use separate modules for the custom widget-set and set the source level, accordingly.

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Versions = YES -->]

The widget-set should start with `<!-- WS Compiler: manually edited -\->` in the module so that it's not manually updated with imports.

The custom widget-set XML needs to import `MprWidgetSet` (e.g., `<inherits name="com.vaadin.mpr.MprWidgetSet"/>`). After changing the widget-set XML, remember to recompile it. When using Vaadin Maven plugin, you can run `mvn vaadin:compile`.
