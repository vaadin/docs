= Legacy theme in MPR

By default the theme used with MPR is 'valo' and this can be changed with
adding the `MprTheme` annotation with the wanted theme name to your `AppShellConfigurator`
configuration class.

[NOTE]
Runtime changing of the theme is not supported

.Sample theme definition
[source,java]
----
@MprTheme("reindeer")
public class Configuration implements AppShellConfigurator {
}

public class MainLayout extends Div implements RouterLayout {
}

@Route(value = "", layout = MainLayout.class)
public class RootTarget extends Div {
    public RootTarget() {
      LegacyWrapper addressbookWrapper = new LegacyWrapper(
                  new AddressbookLayout());
      add(addressbookWrapper);
    }
}
----

The theme can be a old legacy `styles.css` theme or a `styles.scss` theme.
In the case of a SASS theme, on-the-fly compilation works
out of the box without any changes.

== Using your custom theme

Using your own Vaadin legacy theme remains the same as it was.
Create your theme by following the instructions in the themes documentation for
https://vaadin.com/docs/v7/framework/themes/themes-overview.html[Vaadin 7] or
https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/themes/themes-overview.html[Vaadin 8].

Then just add the `@MprTheme` annotation with your theme name on the
root level navigation target and your theme will be used for the legacy
framework part.
