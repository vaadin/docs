= Custom Legacy UI Class

This is intended for advanced cases only, where using the recommended upgrade path isn't enough to cover specific logic that can't be easily ported to Flow.

If you have a need for a specific UI class to be used for the legacy Vaadin UI you can have the UI class extend MprUI. The UI *can not* be used for layout purposes.

[source,java]
----
public class MyCustomUI extends MprUI {
    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
        super.init(request);
    }
}
----

You need to call `super.init(request)` if you need to override the init method. Then you need to tell the application that this class should be used with the annotation `@LegacyUI()` by defining it in a class implementing `AppShellConfigurator`.

[source,java]
----
@LegacyUI(MyCustomUI.class)
public class Configuration implements AppShellConfigurator {
}
----

Now using the application you get a MyCustomUI instead of the default MprUI.
