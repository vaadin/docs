= Using a custom legacy UI class

[NOTE]
This is intended for advanced cases only, where using the recommended upgrade path
is not enough to cover specific logic that cannot be easily ported to Flow.

If you have a need for a specific UI class to be used for the legacy Vaadin UI you
can have the UI class extend MprUI. Note that the UI *can not* be used for layouting purposes.

[source, java]
----
public class MyCustomUI extends MprUI {
    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
        super.init(request);
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
You need to call `super.init(request)` if you need to override the init method

Then you need to tell the application that this class should be used with the
annotation `@LegacyUI()`.

[source, java]
----
@Route("")
@LegacyUI(MyCustomUI.class)
public class MainLayout extends Div {
}
----

Now when navigating to the "" (root) route you will get a MyCustomUI instead of the
default MprUI.
