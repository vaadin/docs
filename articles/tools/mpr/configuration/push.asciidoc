= Push and MPR

In order to enable push mode for any navigation target in MPR, place `@Push` Flow annotation on it.
The annotation has similar parameters (except for the deprecated ones) as the ones used in the Legacy Framework.
Refer to Flow push <<{articles}/advanced/server-push#, documentation>>
or javadocs for particular description on each parameter.

When enabled, push uses Flow implementation, no Legacy Framework push is used.
Although all Legacy methods such as `UI::access` and `UI::push` work as, if nothing's changed, hence no code updates are needed here.
