= Push and MPR

To enable push mode for any navigation target in MPR, place [annotationame]`@Push` Flow annotation on the Flow application shell class.
Application shell class is a plain Java class implementing the [interfacename]`AppShellConfigurator` interface.

The [annotationame]`@Push` annotation has similar parameters (except for the deprecated ones) as the ones used in the Legacy Framework.

See <<{articles}/advanced/server-push#,Server Push>> for instructions to configure push in Flow and Javadocs for particular description on each parameter.

When enabled, push uses Flow implementation, no Legacy Framework push is used.
Although all Legacy methods such as `UI::access` and `UI::push` work as, if nothing's changed, hence no code updates are needed here.
