= Push & MPR

To enable server push for any navigation target in MPR, add the [annotationame]`@Push` Flow annotation on the Flow application shell class. The application shell class is a plain Java class implementing the [interfacename]`AppShellConfigurator` interface.

The [annotationame]`@Push` annotation has similar parameters (except for the deprecated ones) as the ones used in the Vaadin 7 and 8.

See <<{articles}/flow/advanced/server-push#,Server Push>> for instructions how to configure push in Flow and the `@Push` annotation JavaDoc for descriptions on each parameter.

When enabled, push uses the Flow implementation. Vaadin 7 or 8 push implementation isn't used. That said, all legacy methods such as `UI::access()` and `UI::push()` work as before.
