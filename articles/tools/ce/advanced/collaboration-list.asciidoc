= Store Ordered Values in Topics

The Topic API provides the [classname]`CollaborationList` data structure to store ordered values and subscribe to their changes.

A [classname]`CollaborationList` can be obtained by its name in the Topic connection activation callback.

When you have obtained the list instance, you can insert values at the end of the list with the [methodname]`insertLast()` method.

----

Since the insertion is asynchronous, the method returns a result object from which you can get a [classname]`CompletableFuture` that you can use to determine when the insertion has been done.

The result object also provides the `ListKey` of the inserted item, which you can use to replace the item itself, get its current value or remove it from the list.
