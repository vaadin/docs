.Experimental Feature
[IMPORTANT]
====
This is currently considered an experimental feature, which means that its behavior, API, and look and feel might still change.
In order to use the Backend API, it must be explicitly enabled with a feature flag.
See the <<Feature Flag>> section for how to do this.
====

Using Collaboration Engine out of the box in an application running in a clustered environment would result in users being able to collaborate only with others connected to the same app instance (i.e. on the same node).
To properly run clustered application deployments, Collaboration Engine provides the [classname]`Backend` superclass that can be extended to support such multi-instance environments.

In this article we will show how to implement a custom backend to support clustering based on the https://hazelcast.com[Hazelcast] platform.

== Understanding the concept of Event Log

A custom [classname]`Backend` implementation is the gateway Collaboration Engine uses to obtain access to Event Logs.
An Event Log is a strictly ordered log of submitted events involving Topic data, such as newly added items or value changes.
The [classname]`EventLog` API provides methods to submit new events to the log and to add a subscriber to receive all past and future events.
All events are marked by a unique identifier and the API provides a method to remove all events in the log before a given identifier.

=== Implementing an Event Log for Hazelcast

Let's start implementing the [classname]`EvengLog` interface for our reference Hazelcast platform.
Hazelcast provides a very straightforward streaming API based on shared maps and lists.
The Event Log can be easily implemented making use of a Hazelcast [classname]`IList`, but first we need a class to store both the event identifier and payload.

[source,java]

include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/hazelcast/HazelcastBackend.java[tags=id-payload,indent=0]
----

Once we have that, we can start implementing the interface methods.
The [methodname]`submitEvent` takes the event identifier and payload, so we can simply store them in a new [classname]`IdAndPayload` object and add it to the Hazelcast list for this Event Log.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/hazelcast/HazelcastBackend.java[tags=event-log;submit-event;!*,indent=0]
----

To implement subscriptions to events, we're going to add an item listener to the Hazelcast list.
The subscriber receives all past and future events for this Event Log.
A newly added subscriber should initially receive all previous events in the log based on their original order, so that it can catch up with the latest state.
New events should be delivered (in order) only after all previous events have been delivered.
It is not allowed to invoke the [methodname]`subscribe` method again until the previous subscriber has been removed.

The [methodname]`subscribe` method optionally takes the identifier of the last known event, so that only newer events will be notified to the subscriber.
If an identifier is provided and not found in the Event Log, a [classname]`EventIdNotFoundException` should be thrown.

.Exception handling
[TIP]
When the exception is caught by the code calling this method, it may want to re-attempt the subscription with another identifier.

[source,java]

include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/hazelcast/HazelcastBackend.java[tags=subscribe,indent=0]
----
<1> Only a single subscriber is allowed, so we throw an exception if one is already set.
<2> If an event identifier is provided, we check if it exists in the list. If it doesn't, we throw a [classname]`EventIdNotFoundException`.
<3> We add an item listener to the Hazelcast list to handle new items and removed ones.
<4> Then all past events are initially delivered.
<5> Finally we return a [classname]`Registration` that can be used to remove the subscriber.

Let's now dive in into the custom method that effectively delivers the events, the [methodname]`deliverEvents` method.
This is a `synchronized` method to prevent it being invoked by multiple threads simultaneously and to avoid duplicate events being notified to the subscriber.
The method keeps track of the Hazelcast list index to identify the next event and increments this index until all the events are delivered.
If an event identifier has been set as the starting point, no events are delivered until that identifier is reached.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/hazelcast/HazelcastBackend.java[tags=deliver-events,indent=0]
----

Finally, the last method we need to implement for the [classname]`EventLog` interface is the [methodname]`truncate` method.
This method serves the purpose to limit the number of events contained in the log, avoiding it growing infinitely.
It takes the identifier of the oldest known event that should be preserved, or — if a `null` identifier is provided — it empties the whole log.

To implement this behavior for Hazelcast, we create a simple [classname]`Predicate` and pass it to the list's [methodname]`removeIf` method.

== Opening an Event Log

Now that we have a Hazelcast implementation of the [classname]`EventLog` interface, to be able to create and get instances of it we need to extend the [classname]`Backend` class.
Since our implementation only depends on a single Hazelcast [classname]`IList`, it is very easy to implement the [methodname]`openEventLog` method and we do so by returning a new instance of the [classname]`HazelcastEventLog` with the list named after the `logId` parameter.

== Managing Event Log Snapshots

A _snapshot_ is an opaque representation of data at a certain moment in time.
It can be used, for example, by nodes joining a cluster to quickly catch-up with a recent state of data without the need to replay all the events from the beginning of time.
Snapshots are identified by a name, and each version of a named snapshot is assigned with an additional unique identifier.

=== Loading a Snapshot
To load the latest version of a snapshot, the [classname]`Backend` class provides the [methodname]`loadLatestSnapshot` method.
This method can be simply implemented for Hazelcast using a map to store the latest available snapshot.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/hazelcast/HazelcastBackend.java[tags=loadLatestSnapshot,indent=0]
----

=== Submitting a new Snapshot

To submit a new snapshot of data the [methodname]`replaceSnapshot` method should be used.
It takes the name of the snapshot, the expected unique identifier of the latest snapshot, the unique identifier of the new snapshot and finally the payload of the snapshot itself.
To implement this method for Hazelcast, we need some logic to verify that the latest snapshot is the expected one.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/hazelcast/HazelcastBackend.java[tags=replaceSnapshot,indent=0]
----

== Node identity and Membership events

The primary purpose of the Backend API is to support collaboration in applications deployed in clustered environments.
Every [classname]`Backend` instance represents a member of the cluster and is uniquely identified by a [classname]`UUID` which should be returned by the [methodname]`getNodeId` method.
For our Hazelcast implementation, we simply return the local member identifier.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/hazelcast/HazelcastBackend.java[tags=getNodeId,indent=0]
----

When multiple [classname]`Backend` instances are involved, it is necessary to know when a they join or leave the cluster.
For this purpose, the [classname]`Backend` should provide an implementation of the [methodname]`addMembershipListener` method that takes a [classname]`MembershipListener` and notifies it when cluster members join or leave.
Hazelcast itself uses the same concept, so the implementation is very straightforward: we only need to map Hazelcast's events to Collaboration Engine's [classname]`MembershipEvent` events, which take the [classname]`MembershipEventType` (`JOIN` or `LEAVE`) and the identifier of the member.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/ce/hazelcast/HazelcastBackend.java[tags=addMembershipListener,indent=0]
----

.Returning a registration object
[NOTE]
The [methodname]`addMembershipListener` should return a [classname]`Registration` object that can be used later to remove the listener.

== Feature Flag

In order to use the Backend API, it must be explicitly enabled with a feature flag:

1. Create a [filename]#src/main/resources/vaadin-featureflags.properties# file in your application folder
2. Add the following content: `com.vaadin.experimental.collaborationEngineBackend=true`
3. Restart the application.
