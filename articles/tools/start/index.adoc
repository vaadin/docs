The Vaadin Start online interface allows you to manage, configure and download the core of a functional Vaadin projects. At a minimum, you can use them as a starting point to create your own Vaadin applications. Even more so, it allows you easily to do several fundamental things.


== Manage Projects

Vaadin Start allows you to work on multiple projects. You can see a list of your projects in the `My Projects` section. You can download your project from there, directly.

== Add Views

Vaadin Start allows you to add several views to your project. You can select the initial content of each view from a list of more than fifteen Flow and Hilla templates. For example, you can include views based on the Master-Detail template, which can be used to manage an entity's data.

You can then add and modify JPA entities. These entities are downloaded with the generated project, along with their corresponding Spring Data classes, such as the [classname]`Repository` and [classname]`Service`.

== Login & Access Control

You can also configure security and control access. A login view is added for you if you configure one or more views that require a logged-in user. 

In this screenshot you can see the Vaadin Start UI, with the view details popover open, showing the options for the View Access control:

Vaadin Start lets you easily change the look and feel of the application. Specifically, you can adjust the application's colors, typography, style, sizing, and spacing.
