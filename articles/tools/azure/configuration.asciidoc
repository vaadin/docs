= Configuring Azure Kit

// Need a few configuration possibilities or scenarios,
// maybe in separate documents that link from this page.

// The text below comes from Tamas' README file on the demo.
// With some minor changes, it should be usable for this configuration document.

## Scale a Deployment

At http://localhost:8080/counter you find a counter which value is held in the UI.
Pushing the "Increment" button increments the counter and keeps a log of the operation, tracking the hostname and address of the node currently serving the request.

You can simulate the unavailability of the pod handling the requests like this (assume it's the `azure-kit-demo-f87bfcbb4-5qjml` pod):

[source,terminal]
----
# kubectl delete pod azure-kit-demo-f87bfcbb4-5qjml
----

And wait until the pod is terminated and there's a new one running:

[source,terminal]
----
# kubectl get pods
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
azure-kit-demo-f87bfcbb4-jj5c4       1/1     Running   0             12s
azure-kit-demo-f87bfcbb4-czkzr       1/1     Running   0             51s
azure-kit-demo-f87bfcbb4-gjqw6       1/1     Running   0             51s
azure-kit-demo-f87bfcbb4-rxvjb       1/1     Running   0             51s
azure-kit-redis-788d56c66-8b259      1/1     Running   0             51s
----

If you try to increment the counter again, your request is redirected to another pod but the session should be restored and the counter keeps incrementing.
