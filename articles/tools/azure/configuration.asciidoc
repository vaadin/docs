= Configuring Azure Kit

== Include and exclude packages to be inspected during serialization

When the session is serialized, Azure Kit will inspect
classes for transient fields that can be injected during
deserialization (see <<{articles}/tools/azure/session-replication,session replication>>).

Azure Kit provides two properties to limit the packages
that will be inspected. The `include-package` property
defines all the packages that should be inspected. If this
is undefined, all packages will be assessed. For this
reason, it is recommended that you specify the top-level
package for your application in the `include-packages`
property.

The `exclude-package` property lists packages that should
not be assessed.
