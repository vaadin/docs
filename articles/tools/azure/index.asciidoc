Azure Cloud Kit lets you quickly deploy your Vaadin application to Microsoft's Azure Cloud.
Azure Cloud Kit is based on Kubernetes Kit, which means that all the features of Kubernetes Kit are also available in Azure Cloud Kit. This means that both Kits enable the following:

- Non-disruptive rolling updates that don't interrupt user sessions, thus reducing the cost and inconvenience of after-hours deployments.
- Horizontal scalability, which saves on cloud costs by allowing your application to scale down without impacting active user sessions, and scale up when needed.
- High availability, enabling users to keep their active sessions and continue using your application even if a server fails.
- Serialization helpers that make it faster and easier to leverage fully horizontal scaling and fail-over.

In addition to these features, Azure Cloud Kit has the added benefit of facilitating the deployment of your application to Azure Cloud. Azure Cloud Kit does this by providing a set of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates you can use to deploy your application to Azure Cloud.
These templates are based on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters.

Check with the <<{articles}/tools/kubernetes/getting-started#, Kubernetes Kit Chapter>> first to learn more about how to prepare your application to be serializable in order to enable scalability, high availability, and rolling updates. You should first test those functionalities in a local Kubernetes setup. Once you confirm that these capabilities are working as expected in a local setup, come back to this chapter to deploy your application to the Azure Cloud.
