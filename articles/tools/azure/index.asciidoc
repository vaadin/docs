Microsoft Azure is a cloud service provided by Microsoft for application management and related services: software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

The Azure Kit is used to integrate your applications with Azure, to be able to deploy your Vaadin Flow applications to the cloud.

The Azure Kit enables teams to deploy seamlessly and operate Vaadin Java-based applications built using Flow on Azure Cloud. The Kit helps teams to quickly create Vaadin applications that are scalable, highly available, and user-friendly. The Kit is also based on Kubernetes to minimize the risk of cloud provider lock-in.
