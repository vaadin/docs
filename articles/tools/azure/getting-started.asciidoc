= Getting Started with Azure Kit
:sectnums:

This guide covers the following topics:

- Downloading Azure Kit, and configuring it to export data to the infrastructure;
- Setting up TEXT;
// What do they need to set up to get started? -->
- Running a Vaadin Flow application with Azure Kit.


== Download and Configure Azure Kit

Azure Kit is packaged as a Java agent based on the OpenTelemetry standard.
For more information, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/reference#,Reference>>.
// This is the text from Observability Kit. Is there something like this for Azure, a reference?.

link:http://tools.vaadin.com/nexus/content/repositories/vaadin-prereleases/com/vaadin/observability/vaadin-opentelemetry-javaagent/[Download Observability Kit, role="button secondary water"]
// Should they use this: http://tools.vaadin.com/nexus/content/repositories/vaadin-prereleases/com/vaadin/azure-kit-starter/

Next, Azure Kit needs to be configured to export traces to Jaeger, and metrics to Prometheus.
For this, create an [filename]`agent.properties` file with the following contents:
// This is the text from Observability Kit. How is Azure configured?
// Is there a related document to include for it?

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=agent-properties]


== Setup Infrastructure

Use Jaeger to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics.
They both run locally and are suitable for development and testing.
For integration with other vendors, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/integrations#,Integrations>>.

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=jaeger-setup]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=prometheus-setup]

== Run the Application

If you don't have an application to use, you can download an application from https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start], and create a production build with the following command:

// Will this work with the Azure Kit?

```terminal
./mvnw package -Pproduction
```

Then run the packaged JAR file from the [filename]`target` folder:

include::./integrations/_run-app.asciidoc[]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=view-traces-metrics]
