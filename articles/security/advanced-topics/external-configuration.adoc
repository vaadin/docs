== Use System Environment Variables

If your `application.properties` file contains sensitive information, such as database URL, username, or password, 

It is often a bad practice to put sensitive information, such as database URL, username, or password in your `application.properties` files. One of the easiest way to externalize sensitive information is to set those values as system environment variables.

For example, a Vaadin Start project configured to use PostgreSQL might contain the sensitive information below in the `application.properties` file.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
...
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres
spring.datasource.username = postgres
spring.datasource.password = password
...
----

To replace the sensitive information with system environment variables, you edit your file like below.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
...
spring.datasource.url = ${DB_URL}
spring.datasource.username = ${DB_USER}
spring.datasource.password = ${DB_PASSWORD}
...
----

The `${...}` token is the special syntax for Spring's https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.files.property-placeholders[property placeholder], while `DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` represent the actual environment variables that you need to set in your own system.

To temporarily set the environment variables, you can use the commands below in your IDE's terminal.

[source,zsh]
----
export DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres
export DB_USER=postgres
export DB_PASSWORD=password
----

If you want to set the environment variables permanently, however, you must add the commands above into your `~/.zprofile` (_zsh_) or `~/.bashrc` (_bash_) files, depending on your system's default shell.

== Import Configuration From External File

Another simple solution to externalize sensitive information would be to import external properties files using Spring Boot's `spring.config.import` properties.

Assuming that you have a file called `db.properties` to hold your database secrets,

.db.properties
[source,properties]
----
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres
spring.datasource.username = postgres
spring.datasource.password = password
----

then you can import this file into your Vaadin app's default `application.properties` instead.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
...
spring.config.import = file:/Users/MyUserName/secret/db.properties
...
----
