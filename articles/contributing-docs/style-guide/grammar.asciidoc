== Abbreviations
Do not terminate abbreviations with a period if the last letter of the unabbreviated form is included in the abbreviation.
For example:


pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->]


[example]
====
_Mr Smith_ +
_Mrs Smith_ +
_Ms Smith_ +
_Prof. Smith_ +
_Dr Smith_ +
_St Petersburg_ +
_Microsoft Corp._ +
_M. Duval_
+++[+++abbreviation of the French word _monsieur_+++]+++ +
====

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]

In general, plurals of abbreviations are formed by adding a lowercase _s_.
Do not use apostrophe _s_ (_`'s_) for this purpose. +
For example:

[example]
====
_SOPs_ +
+++[+++abbreviation for _standard operating procedures_; not _SOP`'s_+++]+++

_APIs_ +
+++[+++Not _API`'s_.+++]+++
====

Commonly known abbreviations are listed in `.github/styles/Vaadin/Abbr.yml`.

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Abbr = YES -->]

See also <<style#latin-abbreviations, Latin Abbreviations>>.

[[grammar.adverb_phrases]]
== Adverb Phrases
If you begin a sentence with an adverb phrase, place a comma after the phrase. +
For example:

[example]
====
_**Unfortunately,** we cannot reproduce the bug._ +
_**As you can see,** the screen layout is logical._ +
_**This morning,** I spoke to our customer services manager._
====

== Angle Brackets
In general text,the name for the _<_ and _>_ characters is _angle brackets_. +
In other contexts, the same characters are known as the _less than_ and _greater than_ symbols.

[[grammar.apostrophe]]
== Apostrophe (`')
The apostrophe has a specific function: to indicate when one or more letters have been omitted.
For that reason, it is used in contracted forms of verbs.

In general, in our technical documentation, we avoid using contracted forms.
They are correct English, but they are more appropriate to less formal writing.

Nevertheless, to show the function of the apostrophe in contractions in general, here are some examples:

[example]
====
_I am_ -> _I'm_ +
+++[+++The letter _a_ is omitted.+++]+++

_She is_ -> _She's_ +
+++[+++The letter _i_ is omitted.+++]+++

_They are not_ -> _They aren't_ +
+++[+++The letter _o_ is omitted.+++]+++
====

In some cases this logical system of contraction has been adapted, by convention and usage.
For example:

[example]
====
_He will not_ -> _He won't_ +
+++[+++A little illogical, but it is the accepted contraction.+++]+++

_We shall not_ -> _We shan't_ +
+++[+++And not, for example, [line-through]#_sha'n't_#.+++]+++
====

The other standard use of the apostrophe in English is to indicate possession.

In fact, this has its logic. In Old English, the possessive case of a noun was formed by adding _-es_ to it.

In modern English, the _e_ has been dropped from that suffix; this omission is now marked by that apostrophe.

The possessive form of a *single* noun is formed by adding _`'s_.
For example:

[example]
====
_The developer`'s guide_

_The boss`'s office_
====

The possessive of a *plural* is formed by the following process:

* write the ordinary plural form
* if that plural form already ends in _s_ (the commonest case), place the apostrophe *after* that _s_
* in the few irregular cases where the plural form does not end in _s_ (for example, _men_, _women_, _children_, _sheep_), add _`'s_, as for a single noun

For example:

[example]
====
_The employees`' salaries_ +
_The bosses`' salaries_ +
_The women`'s records_ +
_The mice`'s tails_
====

For when to form a possessive using an apostrophe, and when to use _of_, see <<style#style.possessive,Possessive>>.

[[grammar.apposition]]
== Apposition
Consider this sentence:

[example]
====
_The CEO, Nick Smith, spoke to a company employee._
====

In this sentence, _The CEO_ and _Nick Smith_ identify the same entity (in this case, a person).
In other words, _Nick Smith_ is another name for _the CEO_.

In the terminology, the phrase _Nick Smith_ is "in apposition" with _the CEO_. +
Notice that the phrase that is in apposition is delimited by commas.

Now, consider this sentence:

[example]
====
_The CEO, Nick Smith, spoke to company employee Susan Rae._
====

In this case, _company employee_ and _Susan Rae_ do *not* identify the same entity. +
It is likely that there is only one _Susan Rae_ in this context, but there are, no doubt, many company employees. In other words, _Susan Rae_ is not another name for _company employee_.

Hence, _Susan Rae_ is *not* in apposition with _company employee_ and, for that reason, is not delimited by commas here.

Let's look at an example that is more relevant to the context of technical documentation. +
Here is some information about the parameters of a method.

[example]
====
_The method takes a single parameter: `duration`._ +
_The method`'s parameter, `duration`, specifies the time in milliseconds that the animation should run._
====

Here, as there is only one parameter, _the method`'s parameter_ and _duration_ refer to the same entity. _Duration_ is in apposition with _the method`'s parameter_, and so is delimited by commas.

Now, here is some similar information but, this time, the method takes more than one parameter.

[example]
====
_The method takes two parameters: `startTime` and `duration`._

_The parameter `duration` specifies the time in milliseconds that the animation should run._
====

Here, _parameter_ and _duration_ do not mean the same thing.
For this reason, _duration_ is not in apposition with _parameters_, so it is *not* delimited by commas.

== Articles
Missing and misused articles (_a_, _an_, _the_) are a very common problem, especially for speakers of languages which do not have articles, such as Finnish, Russian, and Japanese.

Although the basic concept of articles is quite simple, there are some special cases and exceptions that can complicate the issue.
You may find the following useful:

// Because of Finnish text

* http://materiaalit.internetix.fi/fi/kielet/englanti11/e1_lesson2.htm[Articles] (in Finnish)

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]

== Conditional

[[grammar.contractions]]
== Contractions
Contractions (or "contracted verb forms") are those where one or more letters are omitted. For example:

[example]
====
She's on her way to the meeting. [_She's_ is a contraction of _she is_.]

They'll be here on Friday. [_They'll_ is a contraction of _they will_.]
====

In general use, contractions are perfectly acceptable and correct. In fact, using contractions can help to make a non-native speaker's English sound much more natural.

However, contractions are not generally appropriate in formal contexts, such as academic works and legal documents.
We have made the decision not to use contractions in our technical documentation, perhaps sacrificing a little friendliness of tone in the interests of simplicity of language.

[[grammar.countable_entities]]
== Countable and Uncountable Entities
Some entities have the characteristic of existing as separate objects, such that we can count them. +
For example, books are objects that exist separately from each other, so that it makes sense to talk about _one book_, _two books_, and so on. +
We call this category of objects _countable_.

We view some other entities as existing in bulk, as amounts of something, rather than a number of separate objects that we can count. +
For example, we apply the label _air_ to a contiguous body of gaseous substances. It does not usually make sense to talk about _one air_ or _two airs_. +
The same applies to entities such as _sugar_, _water_ and aluminum. +
We call this category of entities _uncountable_.

From the point of view of grammar, it is important to consider whether or not some entity is countable. +
For example, the indefinite articles, _a_ and _an_, convey the meaning of _one_ of something. +
Hence, it makes sense to use them with countable nouns, but not with uncountable ones. +
The phrases _an air_ or _a water_ have no meaning.

Similarly, countable nouns, by definition, can be plural. +
Uncountable nouns, again by definition, cannot be plural.

However, there is a small trap here. +
Many nouns cannot be categorically defined as either countable or uncountable; it depends on their meaning in the given context.

For example, _time_ as a concept is uncountable. +
It would not make sense to say, for example:

[example]
====
_I'm sorry I haven't got *[line-through]#a time#* to talk to you now._
====
On the other hand, _time_ is countable when it means an occasion or a period. +
For example:

[example]
====
_I remember *a time* when 1 MB was a lot of memory._ +
_How many *times* have I asked you not to do that?_
====

Consider, too, the difference between:

[example]
====
_I don't like *coffee*._ +
and +
_Would you like *a coffee*?_ +
_How many *coffees* have you had this morning?_
====

== Dangling Participles
Participles are formed from verbs.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->]

Present participles end in _-ing_; past participles often end in _-ed_, though there are many irregular forms. Some examples:

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|*infinitive* |*present participle* |*past participle*
|to bring |bringing |brought
|to have |having |had
|to lead |leading |led
|to walk |walking |walked
|to write |writing |written
|===

Participles are often used as convenient concise forms. For example:

====
*Being* the project leader, Hannah Jones chaired the meeting. +++[+++A more concise form of: _As she is the project leader, Hannah Jones chaired the meeting._+++]+++

I was given a spec *written* on the back of an envelope. +++[+++An alternative form of: _I was given a spec that was written on the back of an envelope._+++]+++

*Having* caught a terrible cold, I phoned my colleagues to postpone the meeting. +++[+++In other words: _As I had caught a terrible cold, I postponed the meeting._+++]+++
====

Participles can work well when used in this way, but we need to be careful that our sentence is unambiguous. Consider the last example again:

====
Having caught a terrible cold, I phoned my colleagues to postpone the meeting.
====

Who had caught the cold?
Was it me or was it my colleagues?
Clearly, it was me, but how do we know this?
We know because *we assume that the next noun phrase after the participle clause indicates the person or thing that the participle refers to*.

Look at these similar sentences:

====
Being corrupt, the file was rejected. +++[+++Since the next noun phrase after the participle phrase is _the file_, it is clear that it is the file that is corrupt.+++]+++

Being corrupt, I rejected the file. +++[+++In this case, basing our understanding purely on the word order, we might interpret this to mean that I am the one who is corrupt.+++]+++
====

In most cases of such poorly chosen word order, we can probably guess at the intended meaning.
However, our goal is that our readers should correctly interpret our material on the first reading.

When the structure of the sentence leaves it unclear to whom or what the participle refers, this is called a "dangling" or "unrelated" participle.

Here are some other examples of poorly chosen, and hence distracting, word order, with some suggestions for improvement:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*"Dangling participle" version* |*Improved version*
|*Being* a public holiday, the office was closed.
|As it was a public holiday, the office was closed.
|*Having* crashed three times in one week, we decided to replace the server.
|As the server had crashed three times in one week, we decided to replace it.

== Introduction

[[grammar.nouns_as_descriptors]]
== Nouns as Descriptors
English is very versatile in allowing nouns to be used as if they were adjectives.
For example:

[example]
====
Please close the *office* door quietly.

Select your preferred *keyboard* layout.
====

Bear in mind that when nouns are used like adjectives in this way, they are almost always used in the singular form, not plural.
For example:

[example]
====
She is the manager of a *shoe* shop. +++[+++Not _a shoes shop_.+++]+++

This is the responsibility of the *microchip* manufacturer. +++[+++Not _the microchips manufacturer_.+++]+++
====

== Passive Voice
Grammatically speaking, there are two kinds of voice: _active voice_ and _passive voice_.

An _active_ sentence generally follows the standard _subject&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;verb&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;object_ format. +
For example:

[example]
====
_The dog bit the man._
====

In an _active_ sentence such as this, the subject of the verb (_the dog_) is also the _agent_ (the person or thing that _performs_ the verb).

On the other hand, in a _passive_ sentence, the subject of the verb is *not* the _agent_; that is, it is not the person or thing that performs the verb. +

[example]
====
The man was bitten by the dog.
====

In this sentence, the subject of the verb is now _the man_; but the _agent_ is still the dog. +
In a _passive_ sentence, the _agent_ is indicated using the preposition _by_. +
Specifying the _agent_ is grammatically optional; that is, we may choose not to do it. +
For example:

[example]
====
The man was bitten.
====

We use the passive voice for three common reasons: +

- to place emphasis on a different part of the sentence
- because we do not know who or what the agent is
- because it is unimportant who or what the agent is.

The _passive voice_ is often useful and appropriate. +
For example:

[example]
====
_English is spoken all over the world._
====

To express this as an active sentence, we would have to say

[example]
====
_They (or 'people') speak English all over the world._
====

Unfortunately, this may lead us to wonder who _they_ (or _people_) are, even though in this case it is unimportant. +
For this reason, the _passive_ version is preferable here.

However, in terms of style, using the _passive_ too much can have the effect of making our language sound excessively formal.

Accordingly, avoid using the _passive_ when it is possible to express the same idea elegantly and simply in _active voice_.

== Phrasal Verbs

[[grammar.relative_clauses]]
== Relative Clauses
Relative clauses allow us to give more information about a person or thing that we mention in a sentence.
For example:

[example]
====
*Instead of saying:* _I asked Linda Johnson. She works in the same office as me_,

*it is neater to say:* _I asked Linda Johnson, who works in the same office as me_.
====

They are called "relative clauses" because they relate to some entity in the main clause of our sentence.
The word that links the relative clause to the main clause is often a "W" word, such as _which_, _who_, _where_, _when_, or _whose_.
The word _that_ is also often used as the linking word.
For example:

[example]
====
The software is written in Java, which is our preferred language.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->]

Jean Reboulet, who led the design team, attended the meeting.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]

The conference was held in San Francisco, where the company has its headquarters.

We recommend performing full backups at the weekend, when the system is less busy.

We contacted Sandra Stein, whose team maintains the library.

This is the team that maintains the library.
====

We need to be aware that there are two kinds of relative clause: *defining* and *non-defining*.

Why is this important?
It matters because it has an impact on the punctuation we need to use, and also on the sentence structure.

A *defining relative clause*, as the name suggests, defines an entity in the main clause.
It gives us essential information in order to identify the person or thing that was mentioned.
In other words, without the information in this clause, our sentence would not have the same meaning and might not even make sense at all.
For example:

[example]
====
This is the bug *which our testing team reported*. +
+++[+++The relative clause is essential in order to understand which bug is being talked about.+++]+++

The place *where you parked your car* is private property. +
+++[+++The relative clause identifies the place that was mentioned.+++]+++

====

== Split Infinitive
The infinitive of a verb is the form that includes the particle "to".
Examples of infinitives are _to have_, _to hold_, and _to program_.

Traditionally, it was considered bad style to "split" the infinitive by placing an adverb between the particle and the verb. For example:

[example]
====
It is necessary to *fully* understand the process before starting. +++[+++Instead of, for example, _to understand the process fully_.+++]+++

We had to *completely* rebuild the library. +++[+++Instead of, for example, _to rebuild the library completely_.+++]+++
====

Although split infinitives are generally considered to be acceptable these days, it is worth considering whether you could easily write your sentence so as to avoid it.

However, there may be some cases where strictly imposing the ideal of avoiding split infinitives could result in an awkward sentence or even introduce ambiguity.
Clearly, we need to prioritize simplicity, clarity, and accuracy at all times, even if it means we have to compromise on elegance.

[[grammar.time_clauses_in_future]]
== Time Clauses in the Future
We often use time clauses to refer to some time in the future.
Such clauses may begin with _when_, _while_, _until_, _as soon as_, _before_, and _after_.
In English, we generally use a present or present perfect tense in this type of clause, in spite of the fact that it refers to a future time.
The remainder of the sentence may use any appropriate future form, or an imperative (instruction) form.
For example:

[example]
====
As soon as you *get* to the office, call me. +++[+++Not _As soon as you will get&hellip;_+++]+++

While I *am* in Scotland, I'll visit Edinburgh Castle. +++[+++Not _While I will be in Scotland&hellip;_+++]+++

When you *have finished* that work, you can start the next task. +++[+++Not _When you will finish&hellip;_ or _When you will have finished&hellip;_+++]+++
====
