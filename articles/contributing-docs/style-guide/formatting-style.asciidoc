== Admonitions
Admonition blocks such as `[NOTE]`, `[TIP]`, or `[WARNING]` can be used to emphasize important issues.
However, don't overuse them, as this can interfere with the flow of the text . +
There should be no more than three admonitions on a page.

Use a descriptive title for admonitions. +
For example:

[example]
====
.Don't overuse admonitions
[WARNING]
Overusing admonition blocks interrupts the flow.


.Don't overuse admonitions
[WARNING]
Overusing admonition blocks interrupts the flow.
====

== Author
In some articles, it may be necessary to show the author. +
Authors can identify themselves after the section title as follows:

----
 [.author]
 [name]#Marko Gr&ouml;nroos# <magi@vaadin.com>
----


For section, this should be in the overview.
// Not sure what this means?

For non-ASCII characters, you should use HTML character entity markup.

== Control-Key Combinations
If your audience includes macOS users, provide the appropriate key-naming terminology.
Spell out _Command_, rather than abbreviating it.
For example:

[example]
====
Press kbd:[Ctrl+S] (kbd:[Command+S] on Macintosh) to save.
====

== Capitalization

You should use title or headline case for all titles, including chapter, section, and sub-section titles.

[example]

For a detailed description of capitalization rules, see for example:

== Emphasis
Use the emphasis styles, such as
`+++[+++classname+++]#+++ClassName+++#+++` emphasis for class names and
`+++[+++methodname+++]#+++methodName()+++#+++` for methods.

|====
|Style Element | AsciiDoc Example Code | Result
|Class Names | `+++[classname]`Component`+++` | [classname]`Component`
|Interface Names | `+++[interfacename]`EventListener`+++` | [interfacename]`EventListener`
|Method Names | `+++[methodname]`setValue()`+++` | [methodname]`setValue()`
|GUI Buttons | `+++[guibutton]#OK#+++` | [guibutton]#OK#
|GUI Labels | `+++[guilabel]#OK#+++` | [guilabel]#OK#

|Menu Choices | `+++"Help > Updates"+++` or
`+++menu:Help[Updates]+++`| "Help > Updates"
|====

== Currency
Place currency symbols before the numeric amount. For example:

====
$25.50

€3

&yen;45.00
====

In general, in the absence of other information, we assume that the dollar ($) symbol implies U.S. dollars.
It isn't necessary to specify this.

However, where it's required to distinguish between dollar currencies of different states, it should be written as in the following examples:

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Abbr = NO -->]

====
US$4.50

AUS$19.10

CA$200

HK$99.99
====

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Abbr = YES -->]

No strict rule exists for forming country codes in this context.
Make sure that it's clear which country is being referred to.

== Dates
In our documentation, we use the format `<month> <day number>, <year>`. We don't use the ordinal abbreviation suffixes _-st_, _-nd_, _-rd_ or _-th_.
Nor do we write the word _the_ between the month name and the day number.
For example:

[example]
====
June 15, 2020

May 1, 2022
====

Avoid expressing dates using variations of the _mm/dd/yyyy_ or _dd/mm/yyyy_ formats.
Different conventions for these formats are used around the world, so that the possibility of confusion and misunderstanding is high.
Instead, write out dates using month names, as described earlier.

== Days
Write out the days of the week in full, if space allows this.
Otherwise, abbreviate the names to three characters, as follows:

// Because of Su and Sa
pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->]

[%header,cols="2,1,1"]
|===
|Day | 3-letter abbreviation | 2-letter abbreviation
|Sunday | Sun | Su
|Monday | Mon | Mo
|Tuesday | Tue | Tu
|Wednesday | Wed | We
|Thursday | Thu | Th
|Friday | Fri | Fr
|Saturday | Sat | Sa
|===

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]

== Euro
The _euro_ symbol (&euro;) is represented as `\&euro;` in AsciiDoc.
In amounts of money, place the _euro_ symbol immediately *before* the numeric quantity, in the same way as for, for example, the dollar or pound symbol.

== Listings
You should use the word _follows_ or _following_ to introduce a list or code listing. +
Examples are introduced with _for example_. +
You should end the sentence with a colon (not a period).

For example:

[example]
====
_For example:_

_You can use the following items:_

_It should now look as follows:_
====

== Method Names
Use empty parentheses at the end of method names to denote that they are methods.
In general, don't list parameter types for methods, unless this is required to mention a specific version of a method.
It may also be necessary to specify a parameter when it's relevant in the context.
For example:

[example]
====
Call `setEnabled(false)` to disable it.
====

== Multiplication Sign
If you need to show the multiplication sign, use &times; (`\&times;`), not the letter _x_.
One case for using the multiplication sign is to refer to dimensions.
There should be a non-breaking space on either side of the multiplication sign.
For example:

[example]
====
The image size should be at least 150&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;150 pixels. +
+++[+++That is, _150\&nbsp;\&times;\&nbsp;150 pixels_.+++]+++
====
In code, you need to use the symbol that's required by the language you are using, which is generally the asterisk character (_*_).

== Number Sign
Don't use the _#_ character to display a number.
For example:

[example]
====
[line-through]#See FAQs #3.# +
+++[+++Instead, write _See FAQs number 3_.+++]+++
====

== Procedures
In technical documentation, we very often want to describe the procedures that are necessary to perform some task.
Such procedures usually consist of a series of steps.

Usually, we start with a top-level sentence.
For example:


[example]
====
Create a new project as follows:

To create a new project, follow these steps:
====

Don't start with an incomplete sentence at the top-level which is then completed by the text of each step.
This structure obliges the reader to keep the top-level text in mind to interpret the subsequent text correctly.
For example:

[example]
====
To create a new project, you must: +
+++[+++Avoid beginning with an incomplete sentence which is completed by the text of subsequent steps.+++]+++

Log in&hellip;

Make sure you have installed the plugin&hellip;

Create a new app&hellip;
====

Use parallel structures in the steps that make up the procedure.
In other words, structure each step in a similar way to the others.

== Screenshots
Every page should have at least one screenshot.
There should at least be a screenshot in an introduction or overview section.

// move this to formatting-organization, if not already there
// TODO: check whether it's necessary to keep this, or if it's essentially
// already covered in formatting-organization

== Section
The basic structure of a new section file is as follows:


[example]
====
----
---
title: Title of the section
order: 4
layout: page
---

[[thechapter.thefeature]]
= Fine Feature

[.author]
[name]#Marko Gr&ouml;nroos# <magi@vaadin.com>

The Fine Feature is a feature of a feature...

[[thechapter.thefeature.basic-use]]
== Basic Use
----

&vellip;
====

// == Time
// Use the _ratio_ character ("&ratio;", `\&ratio;`) as the delimiter in times, rather than a standard colon.
// The difference is that the _ratio_ character is vertically centered on the line, whereas the colon character is anchored to the baseline.
// For example:

// [example]
// ====
// The seminar begins at *11&ratio;00* UTC. +
// +++[+++Not _11:00 UTC_.+++]+++
// ====
