== Introduction
It's important to remember at all times that not everybody reads web pages in the same way.
For this reason, web content needs to be created in a way that's understood by screen readers.

== Principles of Accessibility
What does this mean in practice?
Here are a few principles that are worth bearing in mind. +
It isn't always possible to follow them absolutely but, still, they are good aims.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Repetition = NO -->]

In text, spell out, rather than use symbols::
Spell out words like _and_ and _plus_, rather than using symbols such as “&” and “+”.
Screen readers may vary in how they interpret such symbols.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Repetition = YES -->]

Don't use text-formatting characters::
Don't use hard carriage returns and tab characters to format sentences and paragraphs.
These may not work as intended when windows are resized or text is enlarged.

Don't describe screen location using direction::
Avoid using terms like _on the left_, _above_ or _below_ to describe the location of something on the screen; these terms aren't useful for screen readers.

Use graphics with consideration for all readers::
Graphics can be very useful as a way of conveying information quickly and succinctly.
However, you need to be conscious that not everybody is able to see graphics clearly or at all.
+
For this reason, you should also employ alternative ways of communicating the information shown in any given graphic.
Take care that a reader can get the same information in either way &ndash; text or graphic.
