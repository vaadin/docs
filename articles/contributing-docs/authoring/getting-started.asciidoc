= Getting Started with Vaadin Documentation

To make quick corrections or suggestions to the Vaadin Docs, click the *GitHub* link in the bottom-right corner of any page to start making a contribution through GitHub and then do a pull request.
You should pay note to the instructions and limitations for <<editing-tools#github, editing in GitHub>>.

A more flexible way is to use a local editor and tools.

The basic tasks for contributing to Vaadin documentation are:

. <<editing-tools#, Install editing tools>>
. <<#repositories, Clone the Docs Repository>>
. Edit documentation
. <<submitting#, Make a pull request in GitHub>>
. Make possible fixes requested by reviewers


[[repositories]]
== Clone the Docs Repository

The documentation is maintained in the http://github.com/vaadin/docs[`github.com/vaadin/docs`] repository.

Start by cloning the repository.
You should clone it somewhere else in your file system and then create symbolic link to it as described later.

For example:

[source,terminal]
----
git clone http://github.com/vaadin/docs -b latest
----

Then, open the folder or the pages you want to edit in your editor.
