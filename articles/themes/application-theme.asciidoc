= Application Theme

Application Theme is the standard way to organize themes in a Vaadin application, making it easier to switch between themes and allow packaging a theme to reuse in other Vaadin applications.

== Define Application Themes

Figure 1 illustrates a sample theme setup for "my-theme" application theme.

=== Application Theme Folder
Application themes are placed under the `frontend/theme/` folder of a Vaadin project's root location.
This location is fixed.
Each theme is in a separate folder, the folder name is also the theme name.

=== Component Styles

Component-specific style sheets are placed under the `components` folder.
The file name must match the component name that you want to style.
See <<styling-components#, Styling Components>>.

NOTE: Component styles can override <<theme-variants#component-variants, component variants>> styles.
For example, styles in `vaadin-button.css` file can override styles from `ButtonVariant.LUMO_ERROR` variant of a Vaadin Button component.

=== Static Resources

You can create folders for static resources, such as images or fonts.
When using in a style sheet, the resource location is relative to the CSS file location.

For example, in Figure 1, `global.css` file can have `background: url('./images/bg.jpg');`

NOTE: The static resource must be available from the application theme folder for it to be handled, else it should be available with the given URL.

=== Global Styles

Application-specific styling across application views and application-specific components are defined in CSS files under the theme folder.

For example, <<css-custom-properties#,CSS Custom Properties>> or `@font-face` can be defined in a `global.css` file.
See <<styling-applications#, Styling Applications>>.

NOTE: Global styles can override <<theme-variants#global-variants, global variants>> styles.
For example, `Lumo.DARK` variant defines a `--lumo-base-color` which can be overridden by `global.css` file.

==== Use at-rules for Components in non-Vaadin Applications

To make at-rules work for components embedded into non-Vaadin applications (for example <<../flow/embedding-flow-applications/tutorial-webcomponent-intro#, WebComponentExporter>>), add a file called `document.css` to the theme folder, and write at-rules there.

CSS in this file is applied to the document root rather than the page body or shadow root, to support at-rules that don't work inside shadow roots.

At-rules in npm dependencies are declared in `theme.json` using `importCss` property:
[source, JSON]
----
{
  "importCss": ["@foo/bar/baz.css"] 
}
----

NOTE: It is highly recommended to use https://vaadin.com/api/platform/com/vaadin/flow/component/dependency/NpmPackage.html[`@NpmPackage`] for installing npm dependencies so they won't be lost in case you accidentally remove `package.json`.

== Use application themes

In server-side views (Java), use the [classname]#@Theme# annotation to apply an application theme.
You must set the annotation on an https://vaadin.com/api/platform/com/vaadin/flow/component/page/AppShellConfigurator.html[AppShellConfigurator] class, or an error "Found app shell configuration annotations in non `AppShellConfigurator` classes." is thrown.

A theme variant can also be applied.

----
See <<theme-variants#global-variants>>.

NOTE: Any changes to theme folder contents (add/remove files, file modifications) are automatically picked up by webpack.
If a running app has live reload available, you can wait for it to reload the changes, otherwise, you can manually refresh the browser.

== Application Theme as a Dependency

=== Create a Theme Dependency

- Create a separate project with the theme folder inside `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/theme/`
- Put the theme assets into the theme folder
- Build the project into a JAR file

=== Apply Theme to Application Project

- Add the theme JAR as a dependency in a Vaadin app project
- Apply the theme with the `@Theme` annotation
