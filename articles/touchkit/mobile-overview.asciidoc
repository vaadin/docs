= TouchKit

Web browsing is becoming ever increasingly mobile and web applications need to
satisfy users with both desktop computers and mobile devices, such as phones and
tablets. While the mobile browsers can show the pages just like in regular
browsers, the screen size, finger accuracy, and mobile browser features need to
be considered to make the experience more pleasant. Vaadin TouchKit gives the
power of Vaadin for creating mobile user interfaces that complement the regular
web user interfaces of your applications. Just like the purpose of the Vaadin
Framework is to make desktop-like web applications, the purpose of TouchKit is
to allow creation of web applications that give the look and feel of native
mobile applications.

Creating a mobile UI is much like creating a regular Vaadin UI. You can use all
the regular Vaadin components and add-ons available from Vaadin Directory, but
most importantly, you can use the special TouchKit components that are optimized
for mobile devices.

@Theme("mobiletheme")
@Widgetset("com.example.myapp.MyAppWidgetSet")
@Title("My Mobile App")
public class SimplePhoneUI extends UI {
    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
        // Define a view
        class MyView extends NavigationView {
            public MyView() {
                super("Planet Details");

                CssLayout content = new CssLayout();
                setContent(content);

                VerticalComponentGroup group =
                        new VerticalComponentGroup();
                content.addComponent(group);

                group.addComponent(new TextField("Planet"));
                group.addComponent(new NumberField("Found"));
                group.addComponent(new Switch("Probed"));

                setRightComponent(new Button("OK"));
            }
        }

        // Use it as the content root
        setContent(new MyView());
    }
    ...
}

The above example omits the definition of the servlet class, does not have any
UI logic yet, and you would normally implement some views, etc. The resulting UI
is shown in <<figure.mobile.overview.example>>.

.Simple TouchKit UI

TouchKit supports many special mobile browser features, such as geolocation,
context-specific input fields, and home screen launching. On iOS, special
features such as splash screen and web app mode are supported.

In addition to developing regular server-side UIs, TouchKit allows a special
__offline mode__, which is a client-side Vaadin UI that is stored in the browser
cache and switched to automatically when the network connection is not
available, either when starting the application or while using it. For more
information, see <<dummy/../../touchkit/mobile-offline#mobile.offline,"Offline
Mode">>.

In this chapter, we first consider some special aspects of mobile browsing.
Then, we look how to create a project that uses TouchKit. TouchKit offers a
number of specialized mobile components, which are described in a dedicated
section. We treat phone and tablet applications separately, and discuss testing
briefly.

== TouchKit Demos

The Parking Demo showcases the most important TouchKit features for a mobile
location-based business application. The app itself is for helping parking
enforcement officers write parking tickets on the streets. It uses geolocation,
image acquisition from the camera of the mobile device, map navigation, data
visualization with Vaadin Charts, and dynamic UIs with responsive layouts. You
can try it out at http://demo.vaadin.com/parking. See
<<dummy/../../touchkit/mobile-installation-parking-demo#mobile.installation.parking-demo,"Importing
the Parking Demo">> for instructions for importing the project in Eclipse.

of deep category trees and make forms. You can try it out at
