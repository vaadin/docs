[[mobile.features.fallback]]
== Providing a Fallback UI

You may need to use the same URL and hence the same servlet for both the mobile
TouchKit UI and for regular browsers. In this case, you need to recognize the
mobile browsers compatible with Vaadin TouchKit and provide a fallback UI for
any other browsers. The fallback UI can be a regular Vaadin UI, a "Sorry!"
message, or a redirection to an alternate user interface.

You can handle the fallback logic in a custom [classname]#UIProvider# that
creates the UIs in the servlet. As TouchKit supports only WebKit and Windows
Phone browsers, you can do the recognition by checking if the
[parameter]#user-agent# string contains the sub-strings " [literal]#++webkit++#"
or " [literal]#++windows phone++#" as follows:


----
public class MyUIProvider extends UIProvider {
    @Override
    public Class<? extends UI>
              getUIClass(UIClassSelectionEvent event) {
        String ua = event.getRequest()
                .getHeader("user-agent").toLowerCase();
        if (   ua.toLowerCase().contains("webkit")
            || ua.toLowerCase().contains("windows phone 8")
            || ua.toLowerCase().contains("windows phone 9")) {
            return MyUI.class;
        } else {
            return MyFallbackUI.class;
        }
    }
}
----

The custom UI provider has to be added in a custom servlet class, which you need
to define in the [filename]#web.xml#, as described in
<<dummy/../../touchkit/mobile-elements#mobile.elements.settings,"TouchKit
Settings">>. For example, as follows:


----
public class MyServlet extends TouchKitServlet {
    private MyUIProvider uiProvider = new MyUIProvider();

    @Override
    protected void servletInitialized() throws ServletException {
        super.servletInitialized();

        getService().addSessionInitListener(
                new SessionInitListener() {
            @Override
            public void sessionInit(SessionInitEvent event)
                    throws ServiceException {
                event.getSession().addUIProvider(uiProvider);
            }
        });

        ... other custom servlet settings ...
    }
}

[[mobile.features.geolocation]]
== Geolocation

The geolocation feature in TouchKit allows receiving the geographical location
from the mobile device. The browser will ask the user to confirm that the web
site is allowed to get the location information. Tapping [guibutton]#Share
Location# gives the permission. The browser will give the position acquired by
GPS, cellular positioning, or Wi-Fi positioning, as enabled in the device.

Geolocation is requested by calling the static [methodname]#detect()# method in
[classname]#Geolocator#. You need to provide a [classname]#PositionCallback#
handler that is called when the device has an answer for your request. If the
geolocation request succeeds, [methodname]#onSuccess()# is called. Otherwise,
for example, if the user did not allow sharing of his location,
[methodname]#onFailure()# is called. The geolocation data is provided in a
[classname]#Position# object.


----
Geolocator.detect(new PositionCallback() {
    public void onSuccess(Position position) {
        double latitude  = position.getLatitude();
        double longitude = position.getLongitude();
        double accuracy  = position.getAccuracy();

        ...
    }

    public void onFailure(int errorCode) {
        ...
    }
});
----

The position is given as degrees with fractions in the WGS84 coordinate system
used by GPS. The longitude is positive to East and negative to West of the prime
meridian of WGS84. The accuracy is given in meters. In addition to the above
data, the following are also provided:

* Altitude
* Altitude accuracy
* Heading
* Speed

If any of the position data is unavailable, its value will be zero.

The [methodname]#onFailure()# is called if the positioning fails for some
reason. The [parameter]#errorCode# explains the reason. Error 1 is returned if
the permission was denied, 2 if the position is unavailable, 3 on positioning
timeout, and 0 on an unknown error.

Notice that geolocation can take significant time, depending on the location
method used by the device. With Wi-Fi and cellular positioning, the time is
usually less than 30 seconds. With unassisted GPS, it can reach 15 minutes on a
fresh device and even longer if the reception is bad. However, once a location
fix has been made, updates to the location will be faster. If you are making
navigation software, you need to update the position data fairly frequently by
calling the [methodname]#detect()# method in [classname]#Geolocator# multiple
times.

[[mobile.features.geolocation.map]]
=== Displaying Position on a Map

Geographical positions are often visualized with a map. There are countless ways
to do that, for example, in the Parking Demo we use the
link:http://vaadin.com/directory#addon/v-leaflet[V-Leaflet] add-on component.

Notice that the geolocation gives the position in the WGS84 coordinate system
used by GPS. The same system is conveniently used by many Internet map services,
but is not in any way universal. Further, in some countries, map data is legally
required to have erroneus coordinates.

The [classname]#MapView# in the Parking Demo is a TouchKit navigation view that
uses the [classname]#LMap# component from the add-on to display the map:


----
public class MapView extends CssLayout
      implements PositionCallback, LeafletClickListener {
    private LMap map;
    private final LMarker you = new LMarker();
    ...
----

Position is requested from the device when a button is clicked:


----
locatebutton = new Button("", new ClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void buttonClick(final ClickEvent event) {
        Geolocator.detect(MapView.this);
    }
});
locatebutton.addStyleName("locatebutton");
locatebutton.setWidth(30, Unit.PIXELS);
locatebutton.setHeight(30, Unit.PIXELS);
locatebutton.setDisableOnClick(true);
addComponent(locatebutton);
----

When TouchKit gets the position, we center the map as follows:


----
@Override
public void onSuccess(final Position position) {
    ParkingUI app = ParkingUI.getApp();
    app.setCurrentLatitude(position.getLatitude());
    app.setCurrentLongitude(position.getLongitude());

    setCenter();

    // Enable centering on current position manually
    locatebutton.setEnabled(true);
}

private void setCenter() {
    if (map != null)
        map.setCenter(you.getPoint());
}
----

[[mobile.features.localstorage]]
== Storing Data in the Local Storage

The [classname]#LocalStorage# UI extension allows storing data in the HTML5
local storage from the server-side application. The storage is a singleton,
which you can get with [methodname]#LocalStorage.get()#.


----
final LocalStorage storage = LocalStorage.get();
----

[[mobile.features.localstorage.storing]]
=== Storing Data

You can store data in the local storage as key-value pairs with the
[methodname]#put()# method. Both the key and value must be strings. Storing the
data requires a client round-trip, so the success or failure of the store
operation can be handled with an optional [interfacename]#LocalStorageCallback#.


----
// Editor for the value to be stored
final TextField valueEditor = new TextField("Value");
valueEditor.setNullRepresentation("");
layout.addComponent(valueEditor);

Button store = new Button("Store", new ClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void buttonClick(ClickEvent event) {
        storage.put("value", valueEditor.getValue(),
                    new LocalStorageCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(String value) {
                Notification.show("Stored");
            }

            @Override
            public void onFailure(FailureEvent error) {
                Notification.show("Storing Failed");
            }
        });
    }
}));
layout.addComponent(store);
----


[[mobile.features.localstorage.retrieving]]
=== Retrieving Data from the Storage

You can retrieve data from the local storage with the [methodname]#get()#
method. It takes the key and a [interfacename]#LocalStorageCallback# to receive
the retrieved value, or a failure. Retrieving the value to the server-side
requires a client rount-trip and another server request is made to send the
value with the callback.


----
storage.get("value", new LocalStorageCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(String value) {
        valueEditor.setValue(value);
        Notification.show("Value Retrieved");
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(FailureEvent error) {
        Notification.show("Failed because: " +
                          error.getMessage());
    }
});
----

[[mobile.features.upload]]
== Uploading Content

Uploading content from a mobile device works just like with regular Vaadin
applications using the [classname]#Upload# component.

In an offline UI or client-side code in general, you need to handle uploading
differently, using a special upload widget or handler.

ifdef::web[]
[[mobile.features.upload.server-side]]
=== Server-Side [classname]#Upload# Component

In a server-side UI, you can use the regular [classname]#Upload# component
described in
<<dummy/../../framework/components/components-upload#components.upload,"Upload">>.
When choosing a file, the device will ask to select the file from files,
gallery, camera, or other possible sources, depending on the device. The only
difference to normal use is that the upload component must be in __immediate__
mode.

Uploading is supported by most mobile operating systems, such as iOS, Android,
and Windows RT devices, but not in some, such as WP8.

The following example shows how to implement simple upload to an in-memory
storage.


----
// Display the image - only a placeholder first
final Image image = new Image();
image.setWidth("100%");
image.setVisible(false);
layout.addComponent(image);

// Implement both receiver that saves upload in a file and
// listener for successful upload
class ImageUploader implements Receiver, SucceededListener,
                               ProgressListener {
    final static int maxLength = 10000000;
    ByteArrayOutputStream fos = null;
    String filename;
    Upload upload;

    public ImageUploader(Upload upload) {
        this.upload = upload;
    }

    public OutputStream receiveUpload(String filename,
                                      String mimeType) {
        this.filename = filename;
        fos = new ByteArrayOutputStream(maxLength + 1);
        return fos; // Return the output stream to write to
    }

    @Override
    public void updateProgress(long readBytes,
                               long contentLength) {
        if (readBytes > maxLength) {
            Notification.show("Too big content");
            upload.interruptUpload();
        }
    }

    public void uploadSucceeded(SucceededEvent event) {
        // Show the uploaded file in the image viewer
        image.setSource(new StreamResource(new StreamSource() {
            @Override
            public InputStream getStream() {
                byte[] bytes = fos.toByteArray();
                return new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);
            }
        }, filename));

        image.setVisible(true);
    }
};

Upload upload = new Upload();
ImageUploader uploader = new ImageUploader(upload);
upload.setReceiver(uploader);
upload.addSucceededListener(uploader);
upload.setImmediate(true); // Only button

// Wrap it in a button group to give better style
HorizontalButtonGroup group = new HorizontalButtonGroup();
group.addComponent(upload);
layout.addComponent(group);

[[mobile.features.upload.client-side]]
=== Upload on the Client-Side

When making a client-side widget that handles file upload, such as for offline
mode, you can use the GWT
link:http://www.gwtproject.org/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/FileUpload.html[component].
In such case, you need to communicate the image data to the server with an RPC
call.

On a mobile device, the perhaps most common upload task is to capture images
with the integrated camera. To display them in the client-side UI correctly, you
want make sure that they have reasonable size and correct orientation, without
making a server round-trip to do the corrections. To send them to the server,
you want to avoid using too much bandwidth. The [classname]#ImageUpload# widget
included in the [literal]#++lib-gwt-imageupload++# add-on,
link:https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/lib-gwt-imageupload[available from
Vaadin Directory], allows launching the camera application in the device and
capturing an image. It further allows defining an image manipulation pipeline
with transformations to reduce the image size if necessary, correct the
orientation according to EXIF data, and so forth. The corrected image is loaded
to a memory buffer, which you can display in another widget, send to the server,
or store in the local store.

In the following, we allow capturing an image with the camera, normalize the
image and reduce its size, and reduce the size further for displaying it in a
thumbnail. Notice that the image data is encoded as a URL, which can be used as
such in CSS, for example.


----
final ImageUpload fileUpload = new ImageUpload();

// Have a separate button to initiate the upload
final VButton takePhotoButton = new VButton();
takePhotoButton.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
        fileUpload.click();
    }
});

// Capture images from the camera, instead of allowing to
// choose from gallery or other sources.
fileUpload.setCapture(true);

// Normalize the orientation and make size suitable for
// sending to server
EXIFOrientationNormalizer normalizer =
        new EXIFOrientationNormalizer();
normalizer.setMaxWidth(1024);
normalizer.setMaxHeight(1024);
fileUpload.addImageManipulator(normalizer);
fileUpload.addImageLoadedHandler(new ImageLoadedHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onImageLoaded(ImageLoadedEvent event) {
        // Store the image data as encoded URL
        setImage(event.getImageData().getDataURL());
    }
});

// Reduce the size further for displaying a thumbnail
ImageTransformer thumbGenerator = new ImageTransformer();
thumbGenerator.setImageDataSource(fileUpload);
thumbGenerator.setMaxWidth(75);
thumbGenerator.setMaxHeigth(75);
thumbGenerator.addImageLoadedHandler(new ImageLoadedHandler() {
   @Override
   public void onImageLoaded(ImageLoadedEvent event) {
       // Store the thumbnail image data as encoded URL
       setThumbnail(event.getImageData().getDataURL());
   }
});
----

See the Parking Demo for more details about the usage of the add-on.
