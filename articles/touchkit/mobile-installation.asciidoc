= Installing Vaadin TouchKit

You can download and install TouchKit from Vaadin Directory at
link:https://vaadin.com/addon/vaadin-touchkit[vaadin.com/addon/vaadin-touchkit]
as an installation package, or get it with Maven or Ivy. If your project is not
compatible with the AGPL license, you can purchase CVAL licenses from Vaadin
Directory or subscribe to the Pro Tools package at
link:https://vaadin.com/pro[vaadin.com/pro].

Add-on installation is described in detail in
<<dummy/../../framework/addons/addons-overview.asciidoc#addons.overview,"Using
Vaadin Add-ons">>. The add-on includes a widget set, so you need to compile the
widget set for your project.

== Installing as Ivy Dependency

If you use the add-on in an Eclipse project created with the Vaadin Plugin for
Eclipse, you can define an Ivy dependency to automatically download the library.
Include the following declaration inside the [literal]#++dependencies++# section
in the [filename]#ivy.xml#:

[subs="normal"]
----
&lt;dependency org="com.vaadin.addon"
            name="vaadin-touchkit-agpl"
            rev="**latest.release**"
            conf="default-&gt;default" /&gt;
----
You can use [literal]#++latest.release++# revision tag to always use the latest
release or specify a version by its version number. IvyDE should resolve the
dependency immediately as you save the file. See
<<dummy/../../framework/addons/addons-eclipse#addons.eclipse,"Installing Add-ons
in Eclipse with Ivy">> for further details.

[[mobile.installation.maven]]
== Defining the Maven Dependency

You can install Vaadin TouchKit in a Maven project by adding it as a dependency,
as described below, or by using the Maven archetype, as described in
<<dummy/../../touchkit/mobile-project#mobile.project.maven,"Using the Maven
Archetype">>.

To use TouchKit in a Vaadin project, you need to include the following
dependency in the POM. The [literal]#++artifactId++# should be
[literal]#++vaadin-touchkit-agpl++# or [literal]#++vaadin-touchkit-cval++#,
depending on which license suits your project requirements.

[subs="normal"]
----
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.vaadin.addon&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;vaadin-touchkit-**agpl**&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;**LATEST**&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
----
You can use the [parameter]#LATEST# version as shown above or a specific version
by its version number.

You also need to define the repository for the Vaadin add-ons under the
[literal]#++<repositories>++# element:


----
<repository>
    <id>vaadin-addons</id>
    <url>https://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-addons</url>
</repository>
----

Finally, you need to enable the widget set compilation in the POM, as described
in <<dummy/../../framework/addons/addons-maven#addons.maven.widgetset,"Enabling
Widget Set Compilation">>, and compile it.

== Installing the Zip Package

Vaadin TouchKit is distributed as a Zip package that contains the TouchKit JAR,
a JavaDoc JAR, license texts, and other documentation. You can download the Zip
package from Vaadin Directory. A different package is provided for each of the
two licenses, and Directory asks for your choice.

The TouchKit JAR in the package should be put in the [filename]#WEB-INF/lib#
folder of the web application.

Please see the [filename]#README.html# for more information about the package
contents.
