= Live Reload

In Vaadin projects, live reload is supported out of the box for front-end code changes, and for Java changes in Spring Boot projects.
For the latter, it also integrates with popular third-party Java hotpatching tools.

== Front-End Changes

As of Vaadin 23.2, frontend build and live reload features are officially being handled by https://vitejs.dev[Vite] (as the default), but webpack is still supported by enabling its associated feature flag.
See the <<webpack Feature Flag>> section for how to do this.
Support for webpack ends with the next major release (Vaadin 24).

Code in the application's `frontend` folder (JS/TS/CSS files) is monitored by `vite-dev-server` when running the application in development mode.
Adding, modifying, or removing a file in this folder triggers recompilation of the front-end bundle and a browser reload.

== Java Changes

On the Java side, live reload means first compiling the modified code, then updating the running server (either by restarting it or by hotpatching the runtime), and finally refreshing the browser.
Live reload can use Spring Boot Developer Tools automatic server restart feature (enabled by default in Spring Boot-based Vaadin applications).
It can also use two hotpatching tools: JRebel (commercial, for all Vaadin applications) and HotswapAgent (open source, for all Vaadin applications).
See the following sections for details on setting up the chosen technology:

** <<spring-boot#, Spring Boot Developer Tools>>
** <<jrebel#, JRebel>>
** <<hotswap-agent#, HotswapAgent>>

Only one of these technologies should be configured in the project at a time, to avoid interference.
In general, hotpatching is faster than automatic restarts and works best for small, incremental changes.
Larger changes, such as class level modifications or changes to code that affect the whole application lifecycle (startup, shutdown, mapping between front-end and back-end components), usually require a server restart in any case.

== Automatic Server Restart

As an alternative to live reload, the Jetty and TomEE Maven plugins handle automatic server restart on Java changes.
These don't require installing third-party tools, but have the disadvantage that server restarts are slower and the browser doesn't refresh automatically.

** <<cdi#, Automatic Restart with TomEE Maven Plugin>>

== webpack Feature Flag

To use webpack for front-end builds, you must enable it with the `webpackForFrontendBuild` feature flag.

See <<{articles}/configuration/feature-flags#,Feature Flags>> for more information.
