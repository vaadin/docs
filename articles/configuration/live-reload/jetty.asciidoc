= Automatic Restart with the Jetty Maven Plugin

The https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/jetty-11/index.html#jetty-maven-plugin[Jetty Maven plugin] with the `scan` configuration set to a positive value performs complete application restart when the given number of seconds have elapsed since the last Java change.
For instance:

[source,xml]
----
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
        <artifactId>jetty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>11.0.13</version>
        <configuration>
            <scan>2</scan>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>

    <!-- more plugins -->
</plugins>
----

Since the plugin performs a full server restart, all Java changes are picked up.
This includes modifications to server startup listeners, as well as changes to code that connects front-end and back-end components, such as adding a new [classname]`LitTemplate` class, or adding a new CSS import and using it in Java via the `@CssImport` annotation.

However, the session isn't preserved during the restart.
