= Feature Flags

Feature flags is a mechanism that allows developer to enable and test Vaadin experimental features and to temporarily switch back to legacy and deprecated behaviors until they are removed.

Feature flags can be managed in different ways: using Vaadin Developer Tools from the browser, manually editing the [filename]#vaadin-featureflags.properties# file, or by setting Java system properties.
System properties always have higher priority, but their effect is temporary and never overwrites contents of [filename]#vaadin-featureflags.properties# file.

== Using Vaadin Developer Tools

1. Click on the Vaadin Developer Tools icon button in your running application
2. Open the [guilabel]`Experimental Features` tab
3. Click on the toggle buttons to enable or disable the features
4. Restart the application.

== Setting Features Flags Properties File

1. Create or edit the [filename]#src/main/resources/vaadin-featureflags.properties# file in your application folder
2. Add a line for every feature with the following content: `com.vaadin.experimental.<FEATURE_NAME>=true`, for example `vaadin.experimental.enforceFieldValidation=true`.
See <<Available Flags>> or [classname]`com.vaadin.experimental.FeatureFlags` class for the list of available features.
3. To disable a feature remove the corresponding line or set the value to `false`.
4. Restart the application.

== Setting Feature Flags Using Java System Properties

On the command line, IDE launch configuration or tool configuration (for example Spring Boot Maven plugin), set a system property for every feature flags to be enabled or disabled.
The property name should be in the format `vaadin.<FEATURE_NAME>`, for example `-Dvaadin.enforceFieldValidation=true`.

To temporarily disable a feature, use `false` as property value, for example `-Dvaadin.enforceFieldValidation=false`.

See <<Available Flags>> or [classname]`com.vaadin.experimental.FeatureFlags` class for the list of available features.
