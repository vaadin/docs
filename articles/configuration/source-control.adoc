= Source Control

In addition to the standard directory layout of typical Java applications, Vaadin projects also include various files and folders related to the front-end tooling. A typical Vaadin application has a directory layout with something like the following content:

----
frontend                 <1>
└── generated/
└── themes/              <2>
    └── my-theme         <3>
        └── styles.css   <4>
└── index.html           <5>
node_modules/            <6>
src/
└── main                 <7>
    └── java
    └── resources
└── test/                <8>
target/
package.json             <9>
package-lock.json        <10>
pom.xml                  <11>
vite.config.ts           <12>
vite.generated.ts        <13>
tsconfig.json            <14>
types.d.ts               <15>
----
<1> Front-end resources, including CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript files, are placed under this folder.
<2> This folder includes custom themes.
<3> Each theme is in its own sub-folder.
The name of this folder is provided as a parameter to the [annotationname]`@Theme` annotation to apply the theme to the application.
<4> [filename]`styles.css` is the theme's master style sheet that's automatically loaded when the theme is applied.
<5> [filename]`index.html` is an auto-generated file that defines the outermost structure of the application.
<6> A folder that caches the front-end modules that the project depends upon.
This folder is auto-generated based on the contents of [filename]`package.json` and [filename]`package-lock.json`.
<7> Application sources.
<8> Test sources.
<9> [filename]`package.json` defines the version ranges of the front-end dependencies.
<10> [filename]`package-lock.json` defines the exact versions of the front-end dependencies used in this project.
<11> Project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.
<12> Can optionally be used to customize Vite configuration.
<13> An auto-generated file containing the Vite configuration needed for all applications.
<14> An auto-generated file that defines the configuration for compiling TypeScript code in the project, when needed.
<15> An auto-generated file that defines the TypeScript type definitions used in the project.

.Project content may vary
[NOTE]
====
The directory layout shown here may vary depending on the project's configuration.
For example, a project using `pnpm` instead of `npm` has a [filename]`pnpm-lock.yaml` file instead of [filename]`package-lock.json`.
====

The following [filename]`.gitignore` file lists the files and folders that should be excluded from a typical Vaadin project.

.`.gitignore`
