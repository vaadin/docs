= Source Control

In addition to the standard directory layout of typical Java applications, Vaadin projects also include a number of files and folders related to the frontend tooling.
A typical Vaadin application has a directory layout with something like the following content:

----
frontend                 <1>
└── generated/
└── themes/              <2>
    └── my-theme         <3>
        ├── components/  <4>
        └── styles.css   <5>
└── index.html           <6>
node_modules/            <7>
src/
└── main                 <8>
    └── java
    └── resources
└── test/                <9>
target/
package.json             <10>
package-lock.json        <11>
pom.xml                  <12>
webpack.config.js        <13>
webpack.generated.js     <14>
tsconfig.json            <15>
types.d.ts               <16>
----
<1> Frontend resources, including CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript files, are placed under this folder.
<2> This folder includes custom themes.
<3> Each theme is in its own sub-folder.
The name of this folder is provided as a parameter to the [annotationname]`@Theme` annotation to apply the theme to the application.
<4> The [filename]#components# sub-folder is for <<{articles}/ds/customization/styling-components#, component style sheets>> that target the (local CSS) internals of Vaadin components.
<5> [filename]#styles.css# is the theme's master style sheet that is automatically loaded when the theme is applied.
<6> [filename]#index.html# is an auto-generated file that defines the outermost structure of the application.
<7> A folder that caches the frontend modules that the project depends upon.
This folder is auto-generated based on the contents of [filename]#package.json# and [filename]#package-lock.json#.
<8> Application sources.
<9> Test sources.
<10> [filename]#package.json# defines the version ranges of the frontend dependencies.
<11> [filename]#package-lock.json# defines the exact versions of the frontend dependencies used in this project.
<12> Project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.
<13> Can optionally be used to customize webpack configuration.
<14> An auto-generated file containing the webpack configuration needed for all applications.
<15> An auto-generated file that defines the configuration for compiling TypeScript code in the project, when needed.
<16> An auto-generated file that defines the TypeScript type definitions used in the project.

.Project content may vary
[NOTE]
====
The directory layout shown here may vary depending on the project's configuration.
For example, a project using `pnpm` instead of `npm` will have a [filename]#pnpm-lock.yaml# file instead of [filename]#package-lock.json#.
====

The following [filename]#.gitignore# file lists the files and folders that should be excluded from a typical Vaadin project.

.`.gitignore`
