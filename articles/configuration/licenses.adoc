= License Validation and Troubleshooting

Vaadin core includes an extensive set of technologies and components that are free to use.
Vaadin core is available under the terms of the Apache License 2.0, which allows you to use the included technologies and components in any project, even commercially.

You only need a commercial license if you use one of the commercial components (such as, Vaadin Charts) or tools (such as, Vaadin TestBench).
If your project includes such components or tools, a commercial license is needed for development and to build the production application.
In general, you do not need a license after deploying the application into production.
However, the only exception is if you are using Collaboration Engine, in which case a license is needed for the production environment as well as it is priced per end user.

== License Validation on a Local Machine

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Terms = NO -->]

On a local machine, the licenses for commercial components are checked automatically using your https://vaadin.com[vaadin.com] login.
The first time you are using a commercial product, you will be asked to log in to https://vaadin.com[vaadin.com] to validate your license.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Terms = YES -->]
Once validated, you will be able to use the product in your project.
Under the hood, a license key is created in your machine at the following location:


.Windows
[source,terminal]
%HOMEPATH%\.vaadin\proKey 

.macOS and Linux
[source,terminal]
~/.vaadin/proKey


pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Terms = NO -->]

If your local development environment is offline and cannot reach https://vaadin.com[vaadin.com], you need to download an offline license key.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Terms = YES -->]
The offline license key is tied to a *Machine ID* that you submit to https://vaadin.com/pro/validate-license to retrieve the license key.
You can find your *Machine ID* in the logs when you try to use a component offline without an existing license key.

Once you download the generated [filename]#offlineKey# file, you should place it in your _home_ directory:

[source]
~/.vaadin/offlineKey (macOS/Linux) or %HOMEPATH%\.vaadin\offlineKey (Windows)

== License Validation on a CI or Build Server


. Alternatively, you can supply the license key using a system property
+
If defined, the `vaadin.proKey` system property will be used instead of the file in the home directory.
The format of the system property is
+
[source]
-Dvaadin.proKey=<login-email>/<key starting with pro->

For CI/CD servers without internet access, you need to download an **offline CI license**.
This offline license can only be used for production builds.
You can get this license by:

. Going to https://vaadin.com/pro/validate-license.
. Selecting *Generate and offline license for CI only*.

This will generate an [filename]#offlineKey# file that you should place in the _home_ directory of the CI server:

[source]
~/.vaadin/offlineKey (macOS/Linux) or %HOMEPATH%\.vaadin\offlineKey (Windows)


== Common License Questions and Issues

=== License Validation Fails Because Of Proxy Settings

If you are behind a proxy, you may need to configure proxy settings for your IDE.

* Eclipse: https://mkyong.com/web-development/how-to-configure-proxy-settings-in-eclipse/
* IntelliJ Idea: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-http-proxy.html

=== A Popup Appears Indicating That License Has Not been Validated

In some cases, a popup message will appear in the browser window indicating that the license has not been validated.
Specifically, you might see a message that says "_This Application Is Using Components Which Are A Part Of A Vaadin Subscription_".

To address this, you should first verify that you have a valid license by going to https://vaadin.com/pro/validate-license.
Once verified, clear Vaadin cookies and try again, making sure that you use the same browser window.

Sometimes, ad-blockers or 3rd party cookie denial could be blocking the license check.
If this is the case, the error message *only* appears in development mode when in localhost.
When the application is deployed into production and accessed from outside it will not show, thus the message *is not be visible to the end users* of the application.

=== I Get A Trial Message Although I Have A Valid License

Check if you have a valid license by going to https://vaadin.com/pro/validate-license.
If not, either your company's license administrator has not yet assigned a seat for you, or the license is no longer valid.

=== SSLHandshakeException With Multiplatform Runtime

There is a known error in `SSLHandshakeException` reported by users of WebSphere Liberty and WildFly in Docker: https://vaadin.com/forum/thread/18444677/running-mpr-project-on-websphere-liberty-fails-with-suncertpathbuilderexcep.
