= License Validation and Troubleshooting
:hide-uri-scheme:

Vaadin core includes an extensive set of technologies and components that are free to use.
Vaadin core is available under the terms of the Apache License 2.0, which allows you to use the included technologies and components in any project, even commercially.

You need a commercial license only if you use one of the commercial components (such as, Vaadin Charts) or tools (such as, Vaadin TestBench).
If your project includes such components or tools, a commercial license is needed for development and to build the production application.

In general, you don't need a license after deploying an application to production.
The only exception is Collaboration Kit, which requires a license for production use, and it's priced per end user.
See <<{articles}/tools/collaboration/developing-with-ce#,Collaboration Kit documentation>> for details.

[[online-license-key]]
== License Validation on a Local Machine

On a local machine, the licenses for commercial components and tools are checked automatically using your Vaadin account.
The first time you use a commercial component or tool, you are asked to log in to vaadin.com to validate your license.

Once validated, you can continue developing your project.
Under the hood, a license key is created on your machine in the following location:

[.example]
--
[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
%userprofile%\.vaadin\proKey
----

[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="macOS/Linux"></source-info>
~/.vaadin/proKey
----
--

[[offline-license-key]]
=== Offline License Key

If your local development environment is offline and can't reach vaadin.com, you need to download an offline license key.

Each offline license key is tied to a *machine ID*, in the form of `mid-xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx`, that you submit to https://vaadin.com/myaccount/licenses to download an offline license key.

Once you have downloaded the [filename]`offlineKey` file (remove any [filename]`.txt` suffix), you should place it in your _home_ directory:

[.example]
--
[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
%userprofile%\.vaadin\offlineKey
----

[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="macOS/Linux"></source-info>
~/.vaadin/offlineKey
----
--

==== Machine ID

You can find your machine ID in the logs when you try to use a commercial component or tool offline without an existing license key, or by running the following commands on your machine:

[.example]
--
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.vaadin:license-checker-machineid:1.8.1
java -jar %userprofile%\.m2\repository\com\vaadin\license-checker-machineid\1.8.1\license-checker-machineid-1.8.1.jar
----

[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="macOS/Linux"></source-info>
mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.vaadin:license-checker-machineid:1.8.1 && java -jar ~/.m2/repository/com/vaadin/license-checker-machineid/1.8.1/license-checker-machineid-1.8.1.jar

[[server-license-key]]
== License Validation on a CI/CD or Build Server

For CI/CD/build servers, you need to download a **server license key**.
Server license keys can only be used for production builds.
You can download a server license key (an [filename]`offlineKey` file) from https://vaadin.com/myaccount/licenses.

You should place the [filename]`offlineKey` file in the _home_ directory of the CI server:

[.example]
--
[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
%userprofile%\.vaadin\offlineKey
----

[source,filesystem]
----
<source-info group="macOS/Linux"></source-info>
~/.vaadin/offlineKey
----
--

You can also give the license key using the `vaadin.offlineKey` system property or the `VAADIN_OFFLINE_KEY` environment variable.
Copy the license key string value from the [filename]`offlineKey` file.

[.example]
--
[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="System property"></source-info>
mvn -Dvaadin.offlineKey=[contents of offlineKey file here] ...
----

[source,terminal]
----
<source-info group="Environment variable"></source-info>
VAADIN_OFFLINE_KEY=[contents of offlineKey file here] mvn ...
----

=== I Get A Trial Message Although I Have A Valid License
Verify that you have a valid license by going to https://vaadin.com/pro/validate-license.
If not, either your company's license administrator hasn't yet assigned a seat for you, or the license is no longer valid.

=== SSLHandshakeException with Multiplatform Runtime
This is a known error in `SSLHandshakeException` reported by users of WebSphere Liberty and WildFly in Docker.
See the following discussion for more details: https://vaadin.com/forum/thread/18444677/running-mpr-project-on-websphere-liberty-fails-with-suncertpathbuilderexcep.
