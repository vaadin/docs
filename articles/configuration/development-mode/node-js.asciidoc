[[node.installation]]
= Configuring Node.js

Vaadin uses the Node.js runtime in development mode to run the Vite development server, as well as the Node.js package manager (`npm`) and package runner (`npx`) to fetch, install, and run front-end packages.

Node.js can be installed in three ways:

- Automatically into the user's home directory (`~/.vaadin/node`).
- Globally with a downloaded installer or package manager, such as Homebrew.
- Project-local installation (`_project_dir_/node`) using the https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin[`frontend-maven-plugin`].

For the second way, globally, Node.js can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.  Installing Node.js automatically installs the command-line tools `npm` and `npx`, as well.

If Node.js is found globally, Vaadin validates that it's a supported version: if it's too old, it installs a compatible version into `~/.vaadin`. You should use the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version. A project-local installation always takes precedence over a global or `~/.vaadin` installation.

You can force Node.js installation in the `~/.vaadin` folder via the `require.home.node` property. This property sets the Maven `requireHomeNodeExec` parameter value, so you can configure the Maven goal using `<requireHomeNodeExec>true</requireHomeNodeExec>`. To force node installation into the home directory in development mode, you should use the `vaadin.require.home.node` system property or the `require.home.node` web init parameter.

== Proxy Settings for Downloading the Front-End Toolchain

If you're operating behind a proxy server, you should configure your proxy settings so that Vaadin can use them to download the front-end toolchain. Vaadin reads proxy settings from four places.

You can set your proxy data in any of the following:

. System properties;
. `{project directory}/.npmrc` file;
. `{user home directory}/.npmrc` file; or
. Environment variables.

The settings are read from the list here, in this order. For example, if you set your proxy in system properties, the other sources are ignored.

The keys that you should use to define your proxy settings are as follows:

[cols="2,2,3", options=header,frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|In System Properties and Environment Variables
|In .npmrc files
|Description

|`HTTP_PROXY`
|`proxy`
|A proxy to use for outgoing HTTP requests.

|`HTTPS_PROXY`
|`https-proxy`
|A proxy to use for outgoing HTTPS requests.

|`NOPROXY`
|`noproxy`
|A comma-separated string of domain extensions for which a proxy shouldn't be used.
|===

The [filename]`.npmrc` file structure is `ini` -- like Java properties files.
It includes key-values pairs separated by `=`.

Here's an example of the content of such a file with proxy settings:

----
proxy=http://myusername:s3cr3tpassw0rd@proxyserver1:8085"
https-proxy=http://myusername:s3cr3tpassw0rd@proxyserver1:8086"
noproxy=192.168.1.1,vaadin.com,mycompany.com
----

To learn more about the [filename]`.npmrc` file, see the https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/npmrc[official npmrc document].

[NOTE]
====
Starting from Java 8u111 basic authentication for HTTPS tunneling is disabled by default and the download of Node.js may fail
if proxy configuration provides user credentials (see "Disable Basic authentication for HTTPS tunneling" in the https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u111-relnotes.html[JDK 8u111 release notes]).

To make the download work, it is necessary to add the `-Djdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=""` system property to the IDE application run configuration or to the build tool (Maven or Gradle) command line.

== Building an Application Using Travis CI

If you're using https://travis-ci.org/[Travis] as a Continuous Integration server, there are two options to install a proper Node.js version:

. Specify the version via Travis configuration in [filename]`.travis.yml`; or
. Install Node.js automatically through Vaadin.

See link:https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs/#specifying-nodejs-versions[Specifying Node.js versions] in the Travis documentation for information on how to specify the Node version via the [filename]`.travis.yml` file.

You can force Node.js installation to the `~/.vaadin` folder, as described in the section <<node.installation>>.
