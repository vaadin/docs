= Vaadin Development Tools

Boost productivity with the Vaadin Development Tools, such as Component Locator, that are available when running applications in development mode.

Current and future functionality of Vaadin Development Tools may offer developers ways to alter the application configuration or even application code.
Therefore it might not be desirable to enable access to Development Tools for everyone, even when running the application in development mode.

By default, Development Tools can only be accessed from loopback addresses. To configure hosts for Development Tools access, please see `devmode.hostsAllowed` <<{articles}/configuration/properties/#properties,configuration property>>.
