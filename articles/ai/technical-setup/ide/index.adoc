= Configure your development environment for AI

Choose a Java library to call an LLM API from your Vaadin application. For common model options, see:

* https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chatmodel.html[Spring AI — ChatModel]
* https://docs.langchain4j.dev/category/language-models[LangChain4j — Language Models]

== Set the API key in your OS

Use an environment variable in your OS, so the key is **NOT** hard-coded or committed.

[source,bash]
----
# macOS / Linux
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
----

Alternatively, you can provide the API Key as a "local" environment variable through your IDE’s Run/Debug configuration.

Most IDEs allow you to configure **"local" environment variables** or **VM arguments**.

* Environment variables are the recommended option, as they keep configuration consistent across tools.
* IDE specific environment variables are used, if you need an individual configuration for a specific project.
* VM arguments can be used as an alternative
+
----
-DOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
----

For Spring AI, reference the variable in your configuration:

[source,properties]
----
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
----

[NOTE]
Never commit API keys to source control. Prefer environment variables or your CI/CD secret store.


== IDE quick guides

If you’re unsure how to set environment variables in your specific IDE, see:

* <<intellij,IntelliJ IDEA>> (Ultimate or Community)
* <<vscode,Visual Studio Code>>
* <<eclipse,Eclipse IDE>>

== Verify the setup

Run the application and check that the model call succeeds. If you see authentication errors, confirm the variable is set in the environment that starts the JVM and that your configuration references `${OPENAI_API_KEY}`.

For Java/IDE requirements and plugins, see https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/getting-started/prerequisites[Vaadin Prerequisites].
