= AI in Vaadin Applications

In this part of the documentation, we want to show you how you connect a Vaadin application to a Large Language Model (LLM) and efficiently leverage the benefits of this new technology for your workflows. We will use common use cases of typical Vaadin applications as examples and apply common UI patterns for AI integration to create intuitive interfaces and gain the greatest benefit for the workflow in your application. The focus is on simple examples that you can adapt for your application and can be implemented quickly. We show you how to connect your application to an AI client and which components you can use for a user-friendly, efficient, and AI-supported workflow.

We use common Java libraries—such as Spring AI and LangChain4j to call hosted or local models and integrate them into both services and Vaadin views. Examples rely on `MessageInput` and `MessageList` to collect prompts and render responses (e.g. Markdown), keep long conversations focused with a `Scroller`, and deliver real-time updates via `Vaadin Push`.

== Structure
- Technical Setup — Requirements, API keys or local runtimes, and IDE/project configuration so samples run out of the box.

- Quickstart: “Hello AI Chatbot” — A compact chat view with streaming, correct scrolling, and message context.

- Technology Stacks — When to choose Spring AI, LangChain4j, or other options, and how to switch models with minimal changes.

- Typical Use Cases — Chat, Q&A over your data, form assistance, and extract/transform tasks with reusable patterns.
