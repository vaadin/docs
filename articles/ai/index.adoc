= AI in Vaadin Applications

This section shows how to connect a Vaadin application to a Large Language Model (LLM), outline common use cases, and apply practical UI patterns to interact with an AI service and find the most benefit in your application workflows. The focus is on essentials you can adopt quickly: what to install, how to connect an AI client, and which components make the interaction UX-friendly, efficient, accessible, and easy to extend.

We use common Java libraries—such as Spring AI and LangChain4j to call hosted or local models and integrate them into both services and Vaadin views. Examples rely on `MessageInput` and `MessageList` to collect prompts and render responses (e.g. Markdown), keep long conversations focused with a `Scroller`, and deliver real-time updates via `Vaadin Push`.

== Structure
- Technical Setup — Requirements, API keys or local runtimes, and IDE/project configuration so samples run out of the box.

- Quickstart: “Hello AI Chatbot” — A compact chat view with streaming, correct scrolling, and message context.

- Technology Stacks — When to choose Spring AI, LangChain4j, or other options, and how to switch models with minimal changes.

- Typical Use Cases — Chat, Q&A over your data, form assistance, and extract/transform tasks with reusable patterns.
