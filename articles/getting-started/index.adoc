= Welcome to the Getting Started Guide!

This guide will help you set up your environment, create your first Vaadin project, and take you through the essential steps of developing, running, and building your application.

You'll start with a *Walking Skeleton* -- a minimal but functional application -- and gradually expand it into a full-featured Vaadin app. Whether youâ€™re new to Vaadin or looking for a refresher, this guide will get you up and running quickly.
