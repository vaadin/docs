= Build Your Walking Skeleton

Up to this point, the walking skeleton has been running in development mode. Once you've added meaningful features, you can deploy your application to production. To do that, you have to make a production build. The build gathers necessary frontend resources and dependencies. It then transpiles, minimizes and bundles them to make the application load faster.


== Maven Plugin Configuration

In the walking skeleton, you use the Vaadin Maven plugin to make a production build. You do this by activating the `production` profile, like this:

[source,terminal]
----
./mvnw clean package -Pproduction
----

The `production` profile not only builds the frontend, but also excludes the development server bundle since it contains features that aren't used in production. 

If you open the `pom.xml` files, you'll find the following:

[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>production</id> <!--1-->
        <dependencies>
            <!-- Exclude development dependencies from production -->
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
                <artifactId>vaadin-core</artifactId>
                <exclusions>
                    <exclusion> <!--2-->
                        <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
                        <artifactId>vaadin-dev</artifactId>
                    </exclusion>
                </exclusions>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
                    <artifactId>vaadin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>${vaadin.version}</version>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>build-frontend</goal> <!--3-->
                            </goals>
                            <phase>compile</phase> <!--4-->
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
    ...
</profiles>
----
<1> The production build is activated by the `production` profile.
<2> Exclude the development server module.
<3> This goal will generate the production bundle.
<4> Bind the execution to the `compile` phase to make sure the production bundle gets built together with the rest of the application.

== Try It

You can now make your first production build of your walking skeleton. Run the following command to start the build:

[source,terminal]
----
./mvnw clean package -Pproduction
----

Once the build has finished, check the `target` directory. If your skeleton was named `my-application`, you should find a file called `my-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`. Start the application from the JAR by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
java -jar my-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

The application should start up in production mode. Try it out by navigating to: http://localhost:8080 

Stop the application by pressing Ctrl-C.
