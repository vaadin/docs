= Build a Project

Up to this point, the walking skeleton has been <<run#,running in development mode>>. Once you've added meaningful features, you can deploy your application to production. To do that, you have to make a production build. The build gathers necessary frontend resources and dependencies. It then transpiles, minimizes and bundles them to make the application load faster.


== Make a Production Build

In the walking skeleton, you use the Vaadin Maven plugin to make a production build. You do this by activating the `production` profile, like this:

[.example]
--
.Terminal
[source,terminal,subs="+attributes"]
----
<source-info group="macOS / Linux"></source-info>
./mvnw clean package -Pproduction
----

.PowerShell
[source,terminal,subs="+attributes"]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
mvnw clean package -Pproduction
----
--

The `production` profile not only builds the frontend, but also excludes the development server bundle since it contains features that aren't used in production. 


== Try It

Once the build has finished, check the `target` directory. If your skeleton was named `my-application`, you should find a file called `my-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`. Start the application from the JAR by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
java -jar my-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

The application should start up in production mode. Try it out by navigating to: http://localhost:8080 

Stop the application by pressing Ctrl-C.
