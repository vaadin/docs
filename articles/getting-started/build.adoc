= Build a Project

Up to this point, the walking skeleton has been <<run#,running in development mode>>. Once you've added meaningful features, you can deploy your application to production. To do that, you have to make a production build. The build gathers necessary frontend resources and dependencies. It then transpiles, minimizes and bundles them to make the application load faster.


== Make a Production Build

In the walking skeleton, you use the Vaadin Maven plugin to make a production build. You do this by activating the `production` profile, like this:

[.example]
--
.Terminal
[source,terminal,subs="+attributes"]
----
<source-info group="macOS / Linux"></source-info>
./mvnw clean package -Pproduction
----

.PowerShell
[source,terminal,subs="+attributes"]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
mvnw clean package -Pproduction
----
--

Once the build has finished, check the `target` directory. If your skeleton was named `my-application`, you should find a file called `my-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

[IMPORTANT]
Running this JAR directly will fail due to a missing production database. The skeleton uses H2 or PostgreSQL Testcontainers in development mode but expects PostgreSQL in production. You'll learn how to address this later in this guide.

The `production` profile not only builds the frontend, but also excludes the development server bundle since it contains features that aren't used in production.

== Build a Docker Image

The walking skeleton includes a `Dockerfile` that allows you to package your application as a Docker image.

.Install Docker
[NOTE]
You must install Docker on your system before you can build an image.

After creating a production build, run the following command from your project root:

[source,terminal]
----
docker build -t my-application:latest .
----

This command produces a Docker image tagged `my-application:latest`, including the JAR file from the `target` directory.

== Deploy with Control Center

Once the Docker image is built, you can deploy it using <</control-center#,Control Center>>, a tool designed to simplify managing Vaadin applications on Kubernetes clusters.

.Install Control Center
[NOTE]
You must first install Control Center into a Kubernetes cluster. This cluster can be local or cloud-based. For installation instructions, see the <</control-center/getting-started#,Getting Started>> guide.

The walking skeleton is preconfigured to work with Control Center. Specifically, it *requires* the following features to be enabled for the application to run in production without modification:

* *Identity Management* via <</control-center/identity-management#,Keycloak>> for authentication and user management.
* *PostgreSQL Database* provisioned through the <</control-center/database#,Control Center UI>>.

If you choose not to use these features, you'll need to manually adjust the application's configuration to work with a different authentication mechanism or database setup.

// TODO Write a guide or deep-dive about removing Control Center.

For full deployment instructions, see the <</control-center/application-deployment#,Application Deployment>> guide.
