= Prerequisites

To build full-stack Vaadin applications, you need a JDK and a Java IDE.


== Install Java

Vaadin requires at least JDK 17, but you should aim for the latest https://www.java.com/releases/[Long Term Support] (LTS) version whenever you can. Popular, free JDKs include:

* https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/[Eclipse Temurin]
* https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[Amazon Corretto]
* https://openjdk.org/[OpenJDK]
* https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM]


Each JDK has installation packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux.


=== SDKMAN for macOS and Linux

If you use macOS or Linux, a more flexible way of installing a JDK is to use SDKMAN. SDKMAN is a tool that lets you install and switch between multiple JDKs through a command line interface.

Install SDKMAN by following the https://sdkman.io/install[SDKMAN installation instructions]. After that, install the latest stable version of Java by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
sdk install java
----

You can also install a specific version of a specific JDK. See the https://sdkman.io/usage[SDKMAN usage instructions] for more information.


== Install an IDE

Different IDEs have different levels of support for Java and TypeScript. The following table gives a rough evaluation of language support in the most commonly used IDEs.

Each IDE has installation packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
