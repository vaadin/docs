= Prerequisites

Vaadin allows you to build full-stack, web applications in Java. The *Vaadin Flow* framework allows you to build even the user interface using Java only.

You can also build your user interface in https://react.dev/[React] and https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript]. In this case, Vaadin takes care of the integration to the Java backend through the *Vaadin Hilla* framework. You can even combine Flow and React views in the same application.

To build full-stack Vaadin applications, you should be familiar with Java programming. If you want to use React for the user interface, you should be familiar with React and TypeScript as well. Having basic knowledge of HTML and CSS also helps a lot.

On your development machine, you need to install a JDK and a Java IDE.

== Install Java

Vaadin requires at least JDK 17, but you should use the latest https://www.java.com/releases/[Long Term Support] (LTS) version whenever you can. Popular, free JDKs include:

* https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/[Eclipse Temurin]
* https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[Amazon Corretto]
* https://openjdk.org/[OpenJDK]
* https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM]


Each JDK has installation packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux.


=== SDKMAN for macOS and Linux

If you use macOS or Linux, a more flexible way of installing a JDK is to use SDKMAN. SDKMAN is a tool that lets you install and switch between multiple JDKs through a command line interface.

Install SDKMAN by following the https://sdkman.io/install[SDKMAN installation instructions]. After that, install the latest stable version of Java by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
sdk install java
----

You can also install a specific version of a specific JDK. See the https://sdkman.io/usage[SDKMAN usage instructions] for more information.


== Install an IDE

Different IDEs have different levels of support for Java and TypeScript. The following table gives a rough evaluation of language support in the most commonly used IDEs.
