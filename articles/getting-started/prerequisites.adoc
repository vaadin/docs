= Prerequisites

Vaadin enables the creation of full-stack web applications in Java. The *Vaadin Flow* framework allows you to build even the user interface using Java only.

You can also build your user interface in link:https://react.dev/[React] and link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript]. In this case, Vaadin takes care of the integration to the Java backend through the *Vaadin Hilla* framework. This makes it easy to call Java services from the browser using a type safe API. You can even combine Flow and Hilla views in the same application.

To build full-stack Vaadin applications, you should be familiar with Java programming. If you want to use React for the user interface, you should be familiar with React and TypeScript as well. Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is recommended.

On your development machine, you need to install a JDK and a Java IDE.


== Install Java

Vaadin requires at least JDK 17, but you should use the latest link:https://www.java.com/releases/[Long Term Support] (LTS) version whenever you can. In addition to picking a version, you also need to pick a distribution. You have multiple distributions to choose from, all based on link:https://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK]. If you are unsure which one to pick, see the link:https://whichjdk.com/[whichjdk.com] website for independent, yet opinionated recommendations. 

A good, default choice for Vaadin applications is link:https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/[Eclipse Temurin].


=== SDKMAN for macOS and Linux

If you use macOS or Linux, a more flexible way of installing a JDK is to use SDKMAN. SDKMAN is a tool that lets you install and switch between multiple JDK:s through a command line interface.

Install SDKMAN by following the link:https://sdkman.io/install[SDKMAN installation instructions]. After that, install the latest stable version of Java by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
sdk install java
----

You can also install a specific version of a specific JDK. See the link:https://sdkman.io/usage[SDKMAN usage instructions] for more information.


== Install an IDE

Different IDEs have different levels of support for Java and TypeScript. The following table gives a rough evaluation of language support in the most commonly used IDEs.

|====
| IDE | Java  | TypeScript
| link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate]| &star;&star;&star; | &star;&star;&star;
| link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition]| &star;&star;&star; | â€“

| link:https://netbeans.apache.org/[NetBeans]| &star;&star;&star; | &star;
|====
&star; &ndash; Supported with a commercial add-on or a very limited free add-on

&star;&star; &ndash; Limited built-in support or a free add-on with some limitations

&star;&star;&star; &ndash; Good built-in support or a good free add-on easy to install

Each IDE has installation packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

[TIP]
IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate gives the best developer experience.


=== IDE Extensions & Plugins

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, install the link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23758-vaadin[Vaadin plugin].

If you are using Visual Studio Code, install the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vaadin.vaadin-vscode[Vaadin extension], the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack[Extension Pack for Java], and the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vmware.vscode-boot-dev-pack[Spring Boot Extension Pack].

If you are using Eclipse IDE, you should use the Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers.
