= Different Ways of Starting a Vaadin Project


== Vaadin Start

The recommended way to start a Vaadin project is by using https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start], which generates a ready-to-run Spring Boot and Maven based project.

You can choose to include a sample view or create an empty project.


== IDE Plugins

If you have <<../dev-environment/install-ide#,installed the Vaadin plugin for your IDE>>, you can create a new Vaadin project directly from the IDE. Under the hood, the IDE plugin uses Vaadin Start to generate the project. This means you can choose to include a sample view or create an empty project.


== Non-Spring Boot Templates

If you prefer a different technology stack than Spring Boot and Maven, you can find _Hello World_ starter templates for other frameworks here:

* https://github.com/vaadin/skeleton-starter-kotlin-spring[Flow / Kotlin, Maven, and Spring Boot]
