= Setup the Project

In this section, you'll set up the project that you'll be using throughout this tutorial.


== Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed on your development machine:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) {vaadin-start-java-version} or newer
* A Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code

If you need help installing these tools, refer to the <<../dev-environment#,Development Environment Instructions>> guide.

.Use Hotswap for Faster Development
[IMPORTANT]
It is recommended to use hotswap while developing Vaadin applications. Hotswap is the process of reloading changed classes in a running JVM without restarting the application. You can find IDE specific instructions for enabling hotswap in the
<</getting-started/dev-environment/run#,Run a Project>> guide.

== Create the Project

Click the button below to download a minimal Vaadin project skeleton:

link:https://start.vaadin.com/skeleton?platformVersion={vaadin-start-platform-version}&javaVersion={vaadin-start-java-version}&groupId=com.example&artifactId=app&frameworks=none&aiTool=NONE[Download Project, role="button primary water"]   

After downloading the project, unzip it and <<../dev-environment/import#,open it in your favorite IDE>>.


== Add Dependencies

You'll be working with an existing H2 database in the application. To connect to the database, you need to add the H2 database and Spring Data JDBC dependencies to your project.

Open the `pom.xml` file in the root of your project and add the following dependencies inside the `<dependencies>` section:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Then refresh the project in your IDE to download the new dependencies.


== Import the Database

To get started quickly, you'll use an existing H2 database file that contains the necessary tables and some sample data. Download the following files into the `src/main/resources` directory of your project:

* <</vaadin/tutorial/schema.sql#,schema.sql>>
* <</vaadin/tutorial/data.sql#,data.sql>>

The `schema.sql` file contains the database schema, and the `data.sql` file contains sample data. Spring Boot automatically executes these files when the application starts, setting up the database for you.


== Run the Application

To make sure everything is set up correctly, run the application <<../dev-environment/run#,from your IDE>>. Since the application doesn't have any views yet, navigating to http://localhost:8080 should show a "No views found" page. You should not see any errors in the application console output.


== Next Steps

Now that your project is set up, you're ready to create your first Vaadin view. Proceed to the <<list-data#,Build Your First Data List View>> step to continue the tutorial.
