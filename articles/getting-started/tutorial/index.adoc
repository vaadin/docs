= Welcome to the Vaadin Tutorial!

This tutorial will guide you through the basics of building a web application using Vaadin. You'll start with an empty project and gradually add features to create a functional web application step by step. 

You'll be building parts of the back office of a fictional Click & Collect service for a retail company. The application allows employees to manage the product catalog, process customer orders and track deliveries.

In each step, you'll explore different aspects of Vaadin, including UI components, data binding, navigation, and more. Some steps depend on previous ones, others can be done independently.
