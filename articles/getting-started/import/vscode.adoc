= Importing a Project in the Visual Studio Code

To import a project into Visual Studio Code, there's not much to do.

First, in VS Code, select menu:File[Open Folder...]

Next, select the folder containing the Maven project you want to import.

Then click *Select Folder*.

A notification may ask you whether you would like to import Java projects contained in this workspace. Click [guibutton]*Yes* or [guibutton]*Always*.

VS Code may suggest that you install additional extensions. The https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack[Java Extension Pack] and the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=runem.lit-plugin[lit-plugin] extensions are recommended for Vaadin.
