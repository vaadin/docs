= Importing a Project into Eclipse

First, in Eclipse, select menu:File[Import...]

Second, in the *Import* window, select menu:Maven[Existing Maven Projects], and click [guibutton]*Next*.

Then click [guibutton]*Browse* and select the directory that contains the [filename]`pom.xml` file of the project you want to import:

[NOTE]
If you're importing a multi-module Maven project, make sure you select the correct project to import. You typically want to select all the projects.

Finally, click [guibutton]*Finish*. Eclipse imports the project and starts downloading the required resources.

After the import finishes, you are ready to explore the project. If you need to make changes to the configuration, see <</flow/configuration/properties#, Configuration>>.

To run the application, proceed to <<../run/eclipse#, How to Run an Application in the Eclipse IDE>>.
