You can run and debug your Vaadin application in any IDE or editor that supports Java. The `Application` class has a `main()` method, that you should run. The application starts up and you'll be able to access it at http://localhost:8080. Hot deploy of the frontend files is enabled automatically. However, to enable Java hotswap, you have to take some additional actions.

== Enabling Hotswap Manually

To manually enable hotswap support for a Vaadin application, complete the following steps:

1. Install JetBrains Runtime (JBR)
2. Install HotswapAgent into JBR
3. Configure your IDE to launch your application with JBR and HotswapAgent


===  Install JetBrains Runtime

Download the latest _JetBrains Runtime with JCEF_ for your platform from the https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/releases[JetBrainsRuntime GitHub Releases] page. Choose a variant appropriate for your system (e.g., osx-aarch64, linux-x64, windows-x64):

* On macOS, use the `.pkg` installer, which installs JBR under:
`/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jbr_jcef-[version and platform]/Contents/Home`
* On Windows and Linux, download and extract the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive to a suitable location.

[NOTE]
The extracted directory contains a custom JVM with executables like `java` and `javac` inside the `bin/` folder. This is the JVM you'll use to run your application.


===  Install HotswapAgent

Download HotswapAgent (version 1.4.2 or later) from the https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent/releases[HotswapAgent GitHub Releases] page. Install it like this:

1. Create a subdirectory inside the JetBrains Runtime folder: `[JBR]/lib/hotswap/`
2. Rename the downloaded `.jar` file to `hotswap-agent.jar` and place it in that directory: `[JBR]/lib/hotswap/hotswap-agent.jar`

=== Configure Application Launch with JetBrains Runtime and HotswapAgent

To run your application with Hotswap support, launch it using the JetBrains Runtime and provide the required JVM arguments. Use the `java` executable from your installed JetBrains Runtime and add the necessary -XX options for class redefinition.

.Example Command
[source,terminal]
----
/path/to/jbr/bin/java \
  -XX:+AllowEnhancedClassRedefinition \
  -XX:+ClassUnloading \
  -XX:HotswapAgent=fatjar \
  -cp <classpath> \
  com.example.application.Application
----

Replace:

* `/path/to/jbr/bin/java` — with the full path to the java binary in your JetBrains Runtime installation.
* `<classpath>` — with your application's full classpath (use : as a separator on macOS/Linux, ; on Windows).
* `com.example.application.Application` — with the fully-qualified name of your application's main class.

[NOTE]
You may also set these VM arguments in your IDE's Run/Debug configuration, if it supports customizing the Java executable and arguments.


==== Enable Automatic Hotswap

If your IDE does not notify the hotswap agent of recompiled classes, you have to enable it manually. Create a new file `src/main/resources/hotswap-agent.properties` and put the following in it:

[source,properties]
----
autoHotswap=true
----


==== Compute the classpath

If you use a build script to run build and run your application, you can use the following to automatically generate the classpath on Linux/macOS:

[source,bash]
----
CLASSPATH=$(mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=/dev/stdout -q):target/classes
----

A complete build script on Linux/macOS could look like this:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
JBR_PATH="/path/to/jbr"
MAIN_CLASS="com.example.Application"
CLASSPATH=$(mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=/dev/stdout -q):target/classes

$JBR_PATH/bin/java \
  -XX:+AllowEnhancedClassRedefinition \
  -XX:+ClassUnloading \
  -XX:HotswapAgent=fatjar \
  -cp "$CLASSPATH" \
  "$MAIN_CLASS"
----


== Run and Verify Hotswap

Once configured, run your application using the command or launch configuration you've set up. Then:

1. Open the application in a browser.
2. Make a small change in your Java source code (e.g., update a label or log message).
3. Recompile the modified class (your editor or build tool *must support incremental compilation*).
4. HotswapAgent should automatically reload the updated class without restarting the application.

Check your application's logs — you should see messages from HotswapAgent confirming the class was reloaded. If nothing happens, verify that:

* The JVM used is JetBrains Runtime
* `hotswap-agent.jar` is correctly placed in `lib/hotswap/`
* All required JVM arguments are included
