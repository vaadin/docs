= Install JDK

Vaadin requires at least JDK 17, but you should use the latest link:https://www.java.com/releases/[Long Term Support] (LTS) version whenever you can. In addition to picking a version, you also need to pick a distribution. You have multiple distributions to choose from, all based on link:https://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK]. If you are unsure which one to pick, see the link:https://whichjdk.com/[whichjdk.com] website for independent, yet opinionated recommendations. 

A good, default choice for Vaadin applications is link:https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/[Eclipse Temurin].


== SDKMAN for macOS and Linux

If you use macOS or Linux, a more flexible way of installing a JDK is to use SDKMAN. SDKMAN is a tool that lets you install and switch between multiple JDK:s through a command line interface.

Install SDKMAN by following the link:https://sdkman.io/install[SDKMAN installation instructions]. After that, install the latest stable version of Java by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
sdk install java
----

You can also install a specific version of a specific JDK. See the link:https://sdkman.io/usage[SDKMAN usage instructions] for more information.
