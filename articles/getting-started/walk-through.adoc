= Walking Skeleton Walk-Through

Open your newly generated <<start#,walking skeleton>> in your Java IDE. In IntelliJ IDEA, it could look like this:

The walking skeleton is a single-module Maven project. If you are not familiar with Maven, look through the https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html[Maven in 5 Minutes] tutorial before proceeding.

The most important files and directories in your skeleton are the following:

[source]
----
my-application/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── frontend/      <1>
│   │   │   └── ...     
│   │   ├── java/          <2>
│   │   │   └── ...     
│   │   └── resources/     <3>
│   │   │   └── ...     
│   └── test/
│       └── java/          <4>
│           └── ...     
└── pom.xml                <5>
----
<1> Frontend source files, such as CSS and TypeScript files.
<2> Java source files.
<3> Configuration files and other files needed by the application.
<4> Java test files.
<5> Maven POM-file for your application.

The skeleton also contains other files, such as a `.gitignore` file optimized for Vaadin projects. If you don't use Git, you can delete this file.

The `LICENCE.md` file is a placeholder for your application's licence. Replace with your own license, or delete if you don't need it.

To make building easier, the skeleton includes the https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/[Maven Wrapper]. Because of this, you don't have to install Maven on your computer. Instead, you can use the `mvnw` (macOS and Linux) or `mvnw.cmd` (Windows) scripts to run Maven on the command line.

Next, you'll have a closer look at the Java sources, the frontend sources, and the POM-file.
