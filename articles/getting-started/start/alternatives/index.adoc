= Alternative Ways of Starting a Vaadin Project

Although the <<..#,Walking Skeleton Generator>> is the recommended way to start new Vaadin projects, there are other options available. This page explores alternative methods for setting up a Vaadin project.


== Non-Spring Boot Templates

Projects created via https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start] are based on Spring Boot and Maven. However, if you prefer a different technology stack, you can also find _Hello World_ starter templates for other frameworks here:

* https://github.com/vaadin/skeleton-starter-flow[Flow / Java, Maven, and Jetty]
* https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-flow-quarkus[Flow / Java, Maven, and Quarkus]
* https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-spring-gradle[Flow / Java, Gradle, and Spring Boot]
* https://github.com/vaadin/skeleton-starter-kotlin-spring[Flow / Kotlin, Maven, and Spring Boot]
* https://github.com/vaadin/skeleton-starter-hilla-react-gradle[Hilla / React, Gradle, and Spring Boot]

Some guides, such as <<{articles}/getting-started#,Getting Started>> and <<{articles}/building-apps#,Building Apps>>, may not fully apply to projects that are not based on Spring Boot and Maven.
