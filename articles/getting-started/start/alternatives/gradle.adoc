= Starting a Vaadin Project with Gradle

--
--

[.introText]
Gradle is a popular build tool for Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and other projects. It's an alternative to using Maven, and in many ways much simpler. It's also more powerful. You can use it to build and run a Vaadin application and manage dependencies during development.

This page describes how to create, compile, and run a Vaadin application using the Vaadin Gradle plugin. The Gretty plugin is used to run an application in an embedded web server.

See <<{articles}/flow/configuration/gradle#,Gradle Configuration Properties>> page for various options in configuring Vaadin Gradle plugin.

For information about using Gradle, see the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html[Gradle User Manual].

.Requirements
[NOTE]
The Vaadin Gradle plugin requires Java SDK 17 or later, Gradle 8.5 or later, and Node / npm (gets automatically installed).
If you plan to use Vaadin's Gradle-based starter projects, there's no need to install Gradle on your machine. A Gradle Wrapper script is included in starter projects. It manages locally the download and execution of Gradle for your project. For more information on using Gradle Wrapper, see the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Official Gradle Documentation].


== Creating a Vaadin Project

The easiest way to create a new project is to clone a starter repository containing an application skeleton.

You can also make a `build.gradle` file for any existing Vaadin project, as described in <<build-file, The Build File>>.


=== Cloning a Starter Repository

The following starter repositories are available. The default branch is for the latest Vaadin version. You can find older starters with long-term support in their respective branches:


==== Gradle Starter on GitHub

The `link:https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-gradle[Gradle Starter on GitHub]` is a simple web application project to be deployed as a WAR package. This example can also be used for Java EE, by changing the servlet dependency to `javax:javaee-api` and perhaps also adding the dependency `com.vaadin:vaadin-cdi` for CDI integration.

[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
git clone pass:[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-gradle] _my-project_
----


==== Spring Gradle Starter

The `link:https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-spring-gradle[Spring Gradle Starter]` is a web application project skeleton that uses Spring Boot.

[source,terminal,subs="normal"]
----
git clone pass:[https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-spring-gradle] _my-project_
----


=== Gradle files in Starter Projects

Gradle-related files are as follows:

[filename]`build.gradle`::
The Gradle build file, as described later in <<build-file>>.

[filename]`gradlew` and [filename]`gradlew.bat`::
Gradle Wrapper build scripts for Linux/Mac ([filename]`gradlew`) and Windows ([filename]`gradlew.bat`). The build scripts enable the project to be built without having Gradle preinstalled. Since the recommended way to execute any Gradle build is with the help of the Gradle Wrapper, [filename]`gradlew` is used instead of [filename]`gradle` throughout the documentation. However, the `gradlew` and `gradle` commands can be used interchangeably if you already have Gradle installed and you prefer to use your installed Gradle. You can learn more about the benefits of using Gradle Wrapper in the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Official Gradle Documentation].


[[build-file]]
== The Build File

At a minimum, the [filename]`build.gradle` file needs to enable the Vaadin Gradle plugin:

----
plugins {
    id 'com.vaadin' version '24.9.0' <1>

    // Optional
    id 'org.gretty' version '4.1.1' <2>
    id 'war' <3>
    id 'groovy' <4>
}

----
<1> Use the plugin version that matches the Vaadin version. See https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases[`github.com/vaadin/platform`] for the latest release. To try the pre-release version of the Vaadin Gradle plugin, see <<pre-release,Using plugin pre-release version>>.
<2> Use the Gretty embedded web server to run the application during development. See <<running>> for details.
<3> Build a WAR package to deploy to a traditional servlet container. You also need to define the Servlet API using `providedCompile "javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:3.1.0"` in the dependencies section.
<4> By default, the plugin supports Java. You can include Groovy or Kotlin as an optional plugin.


[[compiling]]
== Compiling

To compile your project, You can run `./gradlew build` (Linux/Mac) or the `gradlew build` (Windows) from the terminal / command line tool on your machine. See <<{articles}/flow/configuration/gradle#,Gradle configuration page>> for more build options.

To avoid unnecessary verbosity, only the Unix style of running `./gradlew` is used for the rest of this document. You'll need to replace it with `gradlew` if you're using a Windows machine.


[[running]]
== Running the Application

You'd use a Spring Boot-based starter (i.e., Vaadin with Spring Boot) to run the application during development in a similar way to any normal Spring Boot application. This means you can run it either from the class containing the [methodname]`main()` method -- normally annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` -- or by using Spring Boot's Gradle plugin `bootRun` task:

[source,terminal]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----

If you're using a simple web application (i.e., Vaadin without Spring Boot) to run the application during development, the Gradle plugin supports the Gretty plugin, which runs the application in an embedded web server. You can do this either in an IDE or from the command line.

One way to enable the Gretty plugin is in the `plugin` section of the [filename]`gradle.build` file, as in the starter project:

----
plugins {
    ...
    id 'org.gretty' version '4.1.1'
}
----

You can configure Gretty further in an optional `gretty` block:

----
gretty {
    contextPath = "/" <1>
    servletContainer = "jetty11" <2>
}
----
<1> Sets the context path to the root path. The default context path contains the project name, so the URL would be `http://localhost:8080/myproject` -- adjusted for whatever your project is named.
<2> Use Jetty as the servlet container, with the specified version.

The application is started with the `appRun` task:

[source,terminal]
----
 ./gradlew appRun
----

The task compiles the application and starts the web server in `http://localhost:8080/` -- if the root context path is configured as described earlier.


See the https://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/index.html[Gretty documentation] for a complete reference on using Gretty. For issues when running the application in development mode, see <<{articles}/flow/configuration/gradle#known-issues,Known Issues>> for possible solutions.
