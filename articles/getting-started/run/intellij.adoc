= Run a Project in IntelliJ IDEA

This page describes how to run a project with IntelliJ IDEA.

[[spring-boot]]
== Run a Spring Boot Project

Spring Boot makes it easier to run a Java web application because it takes care of starting and configuring the server.

To run your application, all you need to do is to run the [classname]`Application` class that contains the [methodname]`main()` method that starts Spring Boot. IntelliJ automatically detects that you have an [classname]`Application` class with a [methodname]`main()` method and displays it in the run configurations drop-down.

To start the application, either:

- Click the "play" button next to the "run configurations" drop-down.
- Open [filename]`Application.java` and click the "play" button next to the code line containing the [methodname]`main()` method.

The first time you start a Vaadin application, it downloads frontend dependencies and builds a JavaScript bundle. This can take several minutes, depending on your computer and internet speed.

You know that your application has started when you see the following output in the console:

----
Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path ''
Started Application in 80.189 seconds (JVM running for 83.42)
----

You should now be able to open the web application at http://localhost:8080/[localhost:8080].

== Run Maven Goals

You can use Maven to compile and run a Vaadin application. IntelliJ IDEA has an excellent integration with Maven. You can run common commands such as `mvn install` without having to leave the IDE.

You can run the application in a development server with Maven goals such as `jetty:run` (plain Java), `tomee:run` (Java EE and CDI), or `spring-boot:run` (Spring Boot). With Spring Boot, you can run the [classname]`Application` class, as described in <<spring-boot>>.

- Open the [guilabel]*Maven* view by clicking the vertical tab on the right side of the IntelliJ IDEA window:
+
.Maven Projects View
image::_images/intellij/maven-projects-view.png[Maven projects view]
+
This view shows all the available Maven projects and their https://vaadin.com/blog/learning-maven-concepts[build phases and build goals].

- If you want to run `mvn install`, expand the project tree in the [guilabel]*Maven* view to show the corresponding lifecycle phase.
+
image::_images/intellij/lifecycle.png[Lifecycle phases, 313, 331]

- Double-click [guilabel]*install*.

You can see how IntelliJ IDEA executes the `install` build phase. First, it executes all the previous phases in Maven's default lifecycle. Finally, in the `install` phase, it downloads dependencies and copies the generated artifacts into your local Maven repository, among other things.

You can use a similar approach to run any Maven goal. For example, you can double-click the `jetty:run` goal in the [guilabel]*Plugins* sub-tree to deploy and run the web application implemented in the project you imported. Similarly, if you are using https://vaadin.com/spring[Spring Boot], you can double-click `spring-boot:run` to run the application.

=== Create a Run Configuration

Since using a goal to run the application could be a frequent task during the development, you may want to create a _run configuration_ for it.

A _run configuration_ is a shortcut to run a specific task from within the IDE. In the following, you create a run configuration for the `jetty:run` Maven goal to make it simpler to run the web application.

- Open the [guilabel]*Maven* view.
- Right-click the `jetty:run`, `tomee:run`, or `spring-boot:run` item under the appropriate folder.

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
| Technology Stack | Embedded Server | Goal to Run
| Spring Boot | â€“ | `spring-boot:run`
| CDI / Java EE | Apache TomEE | `tomee:run`
| Plain Java | Jetty | `jetty:run`
|===


- Select *Create `webapp [jetty:run]`* (or `tomee:run` or `spring-boot:run`):
+

- For simplicity, change the name of the configuration to *Run on Jetty* (or *TomEE* or *Spring Boot*)
+
image::_images/intellij/run-on-jetty.png[Run on Jetty]

- Click [guibutton]*OK*:

You should see the new option in the top-right corner of IntelliJ IDEA:

Now you can deploy and run the web application by clicking the "run" (or  "debug") icon in the toolbar:

== Redeployment during Development

If you edit and save any of the source files, they are compiled automatically, but you can only see the changes by restarting the server. In the *Run* panel, click the "rerun" icon, or press kbd:[Ctrl+5] in the editor. You can then refresh the page to use the updated version.

<<{articles}/flow/configuration/live-reload#, Live Reload>> should be enabled by default, making the page refresh automatically.
