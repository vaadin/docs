= Visual Studio Code


You can run and debug your Vaadin application in Visual Studio Code as you would any other Java application. Open the main `Application` class. Then select either *Run Java* or *Debug Java* in the upper-right corner indicated by a red circle in this screenshot:

The application starts up and you'll be able to access it at http://localhost:8080. Hot deploy of the frontend files is enabled automatically. However, to enable Java hotswap, you have to take some additional actions.


== Enabling Hotswap Using Vaadin Copilot

The easiest way of enabling hotswap is to use Vaadin Copilot. Start your application, open it in a browser and move your mouse pointer over the *Copilot* button at the bottom-right corner:

[IMPORTANT]
The Copilot button is only available when the application is running in development mode. It is not available in <<../build#,production mode>>.
Â 
Now click *Development workflow*. Your browser should look something like this:

Copilot guides you through the steps needed to optimize your development workflow. This includes installing the Visual Studio Code extension and setting up hotswap.

When you have completed all the steps, you can verify that everything is working. Start your application with hotswap enabled, and open it in a browser. Then select menu:Copilot[Development workflow] again. All the checkmarks should be green:

== Enabling Hotswap Manually

Enabling hotswapping manually consists of three steps:

1. Download and install JetBrains Runtime;
2. Download HotswapAgent and install it into JetBrains Runtime; and
3. Create a launch configuration for VS Code that runs the application with JetBrain Runtime and additional JVM parameters.

=== JetBrains Runtime

You can download the latest version from the https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/releases[JetBrains GitHub release page]. Be sure to select the correct architecture. Use JetBrains Runtime to execute your application, not necessarily your IDE.


=== HotswapAgent

You can download HotswapAgent from the https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent/releases[HotswapAgent GitHub release page]. You'll need version 1.4.2 or later.

Download the JAR file and place it inside the JetBrains Runtime installation directory as [filename]`lib/hotswap/hotswap-agent.jar`. You'll need to create the `hotswap` folder, and rename the downloaded file to `hotswap-agent.jar`.

If you want to know more about the features of HotswapAgent, the documentation in the https://hotswapagent.org/[HotswapAgent webpage] is a good resource.


=== Launch Configuration

Inside your Java project, create a new `.vscode/launch.json` file with the following contents:

[source,json]
----
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "java",
            "name": "Application",
            "request": "launch",
            "mainClass": "com.example.application.Application", // <1>
            "projectName": "my-application", // <2>
            "javaExec": "/path/to/jetbrains-runtime/bin/java", // <3>
            "vmArgs": "-XX:+AllowEnhancedClassRedefinition -XX:+ClassUnloading -XX:HotswapAgent=fatjar"
        }
    ]
}
----
<1> Replace with your main class.
<2> Replace with the name of your project.
<3> Replace with the path to your JetBrains Runtime installation.

With the launch configuration in place, you can now start the application from the *Run and Debug* tab in Visual Studio Code. Open the application in a browser and verify that everything is working through menu:Copilot[Development Workflow].
