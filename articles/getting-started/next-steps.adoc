= Add Muscles to Your Walking Skeleton

You have now created, started, walked through, and built a Vaadin walking skeleton. Now it is time to start adding muscles to that skeleton, turning it into a fully functional application. The <<{articles}/building-apps#,Building Apps>> section of the documentation contains all the resources you need.


== Add Views & Navigation

Expand your application by adding multiple views and enabling navigation between them. See the <<{articles}/building-apps/views#,Views & Navigation>> guides for step-by-step instructions.


== Implement Security

Secure your application with user authentication and authorization. Refer to the <<{articles}/building-apps/security#,Security>> guides to learn how.


== Use a Real Database

Replace the in-memory H2 database with a production-ready database. Follow the <<{articles}/building-apps/persistence#,Persistence>> guides for details.


== Ensure Quality

Ensure application reliability by implementing comprehensive tests. The <<{articles}/building-apps/testing#,Testing>> guides offer insights into best practices.


== Enhance Styling
