= Creating Login and Logout Links

For users to login and logout, it can be useful to provide them a link or button. This page explains how to do that in a Vaadin application when using the <<../identity-management#,Identity Management feature>> in Control Center.


== Adding Login

To add a login link or button, you'll need to create a component that redirects users to the login page provided by Control Center. Here's an example of how you might do that:

[source,java]
----
public class MainLayout extends AppLayout {

    public MainLayout() {
        // Create a login button
        Button loginButton = new Button("Login", event -> {
            getUI().ifPresent(ui -> ui.getPage().setLocation("/oauth2/authorization/control-center"));
        });

        // Create a login link
        Anchor loginLink = new Anchor("/oauth2/authorization/control-center", "Login");
        loginLink.setRouterIgnore(true);

        addToNavbar(loginButton, loginLink);
    }
}
----

== Adding Logout

To add a logout link or button, you'll need to create a component that triggers the logout process. Here's an example of that:

[source,java]
----
public class MainLayout extends AppLayout {

    public MainLayout(@Autowired AuthenticationContext authenticationContext) {
        // Create a logout button
        Button logoutButton = new Button("Logout", click -> authenticationContext.logout());

        addToNavbar(logoutButton);
    }
}
----

== Deploy the Application

Deploy the application as described in <<../application-deployment#,Deploying a Vaadin Application with Control Center>>. Be sure to activate the Identity Management feature.
