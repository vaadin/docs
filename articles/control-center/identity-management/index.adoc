= Managing Users, Groups & Roles

Control Center provides powerful tools to manage users, groups, and roles for Vaadin applications deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. These features are essential for controlling access to various parts of your application and ensuring secure authentication and authorization for your users.

With Control Center, you can:
- **Manage Users**: Create and manage users, enable or disable them, request password changes, or enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- **Create and Assign Groups**: Organize users into groups, assign specific roles to groups, and streamline permissions management.
- **Manage Roles**: Define roles that can be used to control access to specific views or functionality in your application.

These features allow you to centralize user management, enforce security policies, and control access across different parts of your Vaadin application.

Before starting, make sure you have already deployed an application as described in <<../application-deployment, Deploying a Vaadin Application with Control Center>>. Once your application is deployed, you can manage users, roles, and groups for it using Control Center.


== Creating a New User

To create a new user, follow these steps:

1. First, select the relevant application from the [guilabel]*Application Selector*. This displays the application's dashboard.

2. The dashboard provides an overview of the current user base for the selected application.

3. Navigate to the [guilabel]*Identity Management* section and select [guilabel]*Users*. Then, click the [guibutton]*Create* button to open the user creation form.

4. In the user creation form, fill in the required fields:

- **First Name** and **Last Name**: The user's display name.
- **Email Address**: This is used for the user's login.
- **Password**: Set an initial password for the user. You can also enable the [guilabel]*Request password change* option to force the user to change their password at the next login.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enable MFA to require the user to verify their identity with an additional factor, such as an authenticator app.

Once all the information is entered, click [guibutton]*Create* to finalize the process. The new user should appear in the list of users for this application.


== Creating a New Role

Next, you may want to define specific roles to control access within your application. Roles can be used to limit access to certain views or features.

1. In the [guilabel]*Identity Management* section, navigate to [guilabel]*Roles* and click the [guibutton]*Create* button to open the role creation form.

2. Fill in the fields in the role creation form:

image::images/role-create.png[Role Create Form]

- **Name**: The name of the role (e.g., `ADMIN`).
- **Description**: A brief description of what this role entails (e.g., "Role for administrators").

Click [guibutton]*Create* to save the new role. This role can now be assigned to users or groups to control access.


== Creating a New Group & Assigning a Role

To efficiently manage permissions, you can organize users into groups and assign roles to these groups.

1. In the [guilabel]*Identity Management* section, navigate to [guilabel]*Groups* and click the [guibutton]*Create* button.

2. Fill in the fields to create a new group:

image::images/group-create.png[Group Create Form]

- **Name**: Enter the name of the group (e.g., `Administrators`).
- **Roles**: Select the roles that this group should have (e.g., `ADMIN`).
- **Members**: Add users to this group by selecting them from the list.

Once the group is created, the assigned users inherit the permissions associated with the roles assigned to the group.


== Conclusion

By managing users, groups, and roles through Control Center, you can effectively control access to different parts of your Vaadin application, ensuring both security and streamlined user management.
