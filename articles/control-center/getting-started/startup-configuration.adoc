== Configure Keycloak Hostname

Next, you configure the hostname for Keycloak. This should be a unique external URL that can be used to reach the Kubernetes cluster. For a cloud environment, this can be something like `keycloak.mydomain.com`, whereas for a local environment, you need to create an entry in your operating system's hosts file.
