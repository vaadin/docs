= Upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1

To successfully upgrade Control Center from 1.0.X version to 1.1.X, you must perform three actions:

- Add a configuration property to the Control Center configmap.
- Create a secret that holds the email and password for the Control Center user that was created in the installation wizard.
- Set the docker image of the Control Center deployment to a 1.1 version.

NOTE: All of the example commands below assume that Control Center was installed in namespace named `control-center`.

== Add a New Necessary Configuration Property

Control Center 1.1.0 uses a configuration property that did not exist in 1.0.
If this property is missing, your deployment will not work after upgrading to 1.1.
Edit the configmap for control center, adding the following under the `data` segment:

[source,yaml]
----
# data:
  vaadin.control-center.keycloak.admin-secret: control-center-keycloak-initial-admin
----

To edit the Control Center configmap, run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n control-center edit configmap control-center
----

== Create a Secret for Control Center User Credentials

There must also exist a secret which holds the email and password of the main Control Center user.
These values must be the same that were input during the installation process of the 1.0 version, in the installation wizard.
Assuming the email was `user@example.com` and the password was `examplepassword123`, run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n control-center create secret generic control-center-user \
--from-literal=email=user@example.com \
--from-literal=password=examplepassword123
----

== Upgrading Docker Image

The last step is when you actually upgrade your deployed Control Center application to use an updated image.
Assuming that your Control Center deployment is named `control-center`, upgrade its docker image by running:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n control-center set image deployment/control-center app=vaadin/control-center-app:1.1.0
----

After all these steps are completed, you should now have a working deployment of Control Center 1.1.0 in your cluster.
