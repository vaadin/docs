= Getting Started

To ensure a smooth start with Control Center, you should have a couple of things already in place: a Kubernetes cluster; and a Kubernetes package manager.

A running Kubernetes cluster is essential. This could be a cloud-based Kubernetes service like https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)], https://aws.amazon.com/eks[Amazon EKS], or https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service[Azure AKS]. As an alternative, you could use a locally managed cluster within https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker Desktop], or https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io[minikube]. The choice depends on your project needs and scalability considerations.

As for a Kubernetes package manager, https://helm.sh[Helm] is a powerful one. It simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes. Make sure Helm is installed and configured to interact with your cluster.


== Deploy Control Center

The process begins with deploying Control Center to your Kubernetes cluster. This step involves using Helm, the Kubernetes package manager. It simplifies the deployment process and sets up Control Center with the necessary configurations. To do this, open a terminal and execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
helm install control-center oci://docker.io/vaadin/control-center \
    -n control-center --create-namespace \
    --set serviceAccount.clusterAdmin=true \
    --set service.type=LoadBalancer --set service.port=8000
----

This command does several things:

- `helm install control-center oci://docker.io/vaadin/control-center`
tells Helm to install the Control Center package from the specified repository;
- `-n control-center --create-namespace`
ensures that a dedicated namespace is created for Control Center, keeping it isolated from other applications;
- `--set serviceAccount.clusterAdmin=true`
grants Control Center administrative privileges, allowing it to manage cluster resources, effectively;
- `--set service.type=LoadBalancer --set service.port=8000`
configures the service to use a load-balancer -- which is ideal for cloud deployments -- and sets the service port to 8000. This port works on a local cluster; otherwise, use whatever port connects to your cloud provider.

[NOTE]
You don't have to grant Control Center administrative privileges on the cluster, but it'll allow automatic installation of required dependencies. Otherwise, you'll need to install any required resource, manually.
