= Getting Started


== Prerequisites

To ensure a smooth start with Control Center, you should have a couple of htings already in place: a Kubernetes cluster; and a Kubernetes package manager.

A running Kubernetes cluster is essential. This could be a cloud-based Kubernetes service like https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)], https://aws.amazon.com/eks[Amazon EKS], or https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service[Azure AKS]. As an alternative, you could use a locally managed cluster within https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker Desktop], or https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io[minikube]. The choice depends on your project needs and scalability considerations.

As for a Kubernetes package manager, https://helm.sh[Helm] is a powerful one. It simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes. Ensure you have Helm installed and configured to interact with your cluster.


== Deploy Control Center

The process begins with deploying Control Center to your Kubernetes cluster. This step involves using Helm, the Kubernetes package manager. It simplifies the deployment process and sets up Control Center with the necessary configurations. To do this, open a terminal and execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
helm install control-center oci://docker.io/vaadin/control-center \
    -n control-center --create-namespace \
    --set serviceAccount.clusterAdmin=true \
    --set service.type=LoadBalancer --set service.port=8000
----

This command does several things:

- `helm install control-center oci://docker.io/vaadin/control-center`
tells Helm to install the Control Center package from the specified repository;
- `-n control-center --create-namespace`
ensures that a dedicated namespace is created for Control Center, keeping it isolated from other applications;
- `--set serviceAccount.clusterAdmin=true`
grants Control Center administrative privileges, allowing it to manage cluster resources effectively;
- `--set service.type=LoadBalancer --set service.port=8000`
configures the service to use a load-balancer (ideal for cloud deployments) and sets the service port to 8000 (this works on local cluster, otherwise use any port that works to connect to your cloud provider).

[NOTE]
You don't have to grant Control Center administrative privileges on the cluster, but it allows automatic installation of required dependencies. Otherwise, you'll need to install any required resource manually.
