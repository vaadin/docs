= Uninstalling Control Center

To uninstall Control Center from your Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to execute the following command in a terminal:

[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall installation-name -n installation-namespace
----

Replace `installation-name` with the name of the Helm release you used when installing Control Center, and `installation-namespace` with the namespace where Control Center was installed.


== Orphaned Applications

If you have <<../application-deployment#,deployed an application>> using Control Center, uninstalling Control Center will not remove the application from your cluster. This may cause the application to be left in an unusable state if any Control Center features have been enabled. It will also not be reachable via the URL that Control Center provided.

It is recommended to remove all resources created by Control Center, including deployed applications, by deleting the entire namespace where Control Center was installed. This can be done by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete namespace installation-namespace
----

Replace `installation-namespace` with the namespace where Control Center was installed.
