= Uninstalling Control Center

To uninstall Control Center from a Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to use `helm`. Execute the following in a terminal, adjusting the names to your installation:

[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall installation-name -n installation-namespace
----

Replace `installation-name` with the name of the Helm release you used when installing Control Center, and `installation-namespace` with the namespace where Control Center was installed.


== Orphaned Applications

If you <<../application-deployment#,deployed an application>> using Control Center, uninstalling Control Center won't remove the application from your cluster. As a result, this may cause the application to be left in an unusable state if any Control Center features have been enabled. It also won't be reachable via the URL that Control Center provided.

It's best to remove all resources created by Control Center, including any deployed applications, by deleting the entire namespace where Control Center was installed. This can be done by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete namespace installation-namespace
----

You'll have to replace `installation-namespace` with the namespace where Control Center was installed.
