Control Center is a platform for deploying, managing, and monitoring Vaadin applications in cloud environments. It simplifies production-grade operations by offering an opinionated link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[Kubernetes Operator,window=read-later] and a management UIâ€”both built with the link:https://vaadin.com/[Vaadin Platform,window=read-later] and integrated with industry-standard cloud-native tooling.

== Simplified Deployment and Scaling

Deploying applications in cloud environments often requires complex configuration and orchestration of multiple resources. Control Center reduces this complexity by enabling the deployment of Vaadin applications to Kubernetes clusters using a single command. All required resources are automatically configured.

Key features:

- *Effortless Application Deployment*: Production builds of Vaadin applications can be deployed to Kubernetes clusters with minimal setup.
- *Automatic Resource Configuration*: Applications are automatically configured to integrate with other Kubernetes resources, such as databases and secrets.
- *Scaling and Load Balancing*: Built-in support for horizontal scaling and load balancing ensures high availability and consistent performance.
- *Automated TLS Certificates*: TLS certificates for deployed applications are automatically issued and renewed using Let's Encrypt or a configured certificate manager.
- *Automated DNS Record Management*: For supported DNS providers, Control Center can automatically create and update DNS records for each deployed application.

By abstracting Kubernetes internals, Control Center enables efficient and reliable application delivery without requiring specialized platform knowledge.

== Database and Backup Management

Many Vaadin applications depend on a relational database. Control Center includes built-in capabilities for provisioning and managing link:https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL,window=read-later] databases, enabling smooth integration and maintenance.

Core capabilities:

- *Managed Database Provisioning*: PostgreSQL databases can be created automatically alongside application deployments, with secure credentials and access controls.
- *Integrated Schema Migrations*: Support for Flyway-based migrations allows applications to manage schema versions declaratively, with automated execution during deployment.
- *Scheduled Backups*: Control Center can automatically back up managed databases to secure, configurable storage locations, supporting scheduled and on-demand backup strategies.

These features ensure that data storage, migration, and recovery are streamlined, reducing operational overhead and improving reliability.

== Identity and Access Management

Modern applications require robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Control Center includes comprehensive identity and access management capabilities to secure application access.

Core capabilities:

- *Authentication Enforcement*: Applications can be configured to require user authentication by default.
- *Centralized Access Management*: Users, groups, and roles are managed through an intuitive UI, streamlining access control configuration.
- *External Identity Provider Support*: Integration with OpenID Connect providers, including social identity platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook), enables flexible authentication workflows.
- [.commercial]*Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)*: Additional protection through authenticator apps can be enabled to strengthen identity verification.
- [.commercial]*Passwordless Authentication*: Passkey support allows secure, frictionless sign-in without the risks associated with traditional passwords.

These features contribute to a more secure application landscape, helping to reduce unauthorized access and data breaches.

== Robust Localization Support

:commercial-feature: Localization
include::{articles}/_commercial-banner.adoc[opts=optional]

Reaching a global audience requires support for localized content. Control Center includes features for managing translations across multiple languages, making it easier to deliver user interfaces tailored to regional audiences.

Localization capabilities:

- *Translation File Management*: Upload and download translation files, including those generated with Vaadin Copilot, directly through the UI.
- *Multi-Language Support*: Multiple languages can be added and updated easily as application requirements evolve.
- *Live Preview*: Applications can be previewed with live translations, ensuring accuracy and completeness before changes are published.

Localization improves user experience and engagement by delivering content in familiar languages.
