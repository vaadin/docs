= Upgrade, Install Specific Versions, and Uninstall

Control Center is installed and managed using link:https://helm.sh/[Helm,window=read-later]. By default, installing or upgrading without specifying a version uses the latest available stable release.

== Installing or Upgrading to a Specific Version

To install or upgrade to a specific version of Control Center, use the `--version` flag with the `helm install` or `helm upgrade` command. The version must match a link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vaadin/control-center/tags[published chart version,window=read-later].

To view the currently installed version, use the following command:

.Terminal
[source,shell]
----
# List installed Helm releases in all namespaces
helm list -A
----

== Upgrading an Existing Installation

To upgrade an existing installation to the latest version while retaining the current configuration, use:

.Terminal
[source,shell]
----
helm upgrade control-center oci://docker.io/vaadin/control-center \
  --namespace vaadin \
  --reuse-values
----

This command reuses the values from the current installation.

To apply changes to the configuration while upgrading, specify a custom values file:

.Terminal
[source,shell]
----
helm upgrade control-center oci://docker.io/vaadin/control-center \
  --namespace vaadin \
  -f updated-values.yaml
----

The upgrade command can be used to:

* Upgrade Control Center to the latest version
* Apply changes to configuration (for example, enabling DNS or certificate management)
* Roll forward to a specific version

To upgrade to a specific version, use the `--version` flag:

.Terminal
[source,shell]
----
helm upgrade control-center oci://docker.io/vaadin/control-center \
  --namespace vaadin \
  --version 2.1.0 \
  --reuse-values
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Downgrading to a previous version is not supported and may result in broken configurations, data loss, or orphaned resources.
====

== Uninstalling Control Center

To completely remove Control Center and all associated resources:

.Terminal
[source,shell]
----
helm uninstall control-center --namespace vaadin
----

[WARNING]
====
Uninstalling Control Center removes all its components and may delete provisioned databases along with their data. This can lead to data loss and orphaned applications. It is recommended to back up any important data before proceeding.
====

To also delete the namespace:

.Terminal
[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete namespace vaadin
----

This step is optional and depends on whether other workloads are running in the same namespace.
