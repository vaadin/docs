= Flyway Migrations

Control Center provides a simple way to set up Flyway migrations to initialize your database. This guide will walk you through the steps to configure Flyway migrations for your Vaadin application using Control Center.


== Migration Files

Flyway migrations are SQL scripts that define the changes to be applied to your database schema. These scripts should be placed in the `src/main/resources/db/migration` directory of your project. The naming convention for migration files is `V<version>__<description>.sql`, where `<version>` is a version number and `<description>` is a brief description of the migration.

For example, a migration file to create a `users` table might be named `V1__Create_users_table.sql`. The contents of the file could look like this:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('admin', 'admin');
----

You can create multiple migration files, and Flyway applies them in order based on their version numbers. Ideally, each migration file should contain a single change to the database schema, such as creating a table, adding a column, or modifying data.

More information about Flyway migration files can be found in the [Flyway documentation](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd).


== Flyway and Control Center

Build and deploy your application with Control Center as described in the <<../application-deployment#,Deploying an Application with Control Center>> guide, making sure to enable the Database feature. Control Center automatically detects the migration files in your project and applies them to the database when the application starts.
