= Flyway Migrations

Control Center provides a simple way to set up Flyway migrations to initialize your database. This guide walks you through the steps to configure Flyway migrations for your Vaadin application using Control Center.


== Control Center Starter

If you haven't already done so, add the Control Center Starter to your project. You will also need to ensure that you have the Flyway PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL dependencies in your project.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>control-center-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-database-postgresql</artifactId>
    <version>11.7.2</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

Once these dependencies are added and the Database feature is enabled, any migrations you create are automatically detected and applied to your database when the application starts.

IMPORTANT: The Database feature must be <<../database#provisioning-a-database,enabled>> in order for Flyway migrations to be applied to the Control Center-managed database. If you have not already enabled the Database feature, you can do so during the deployment of your application or for an application that is already deployed.


== Migration Files

Flyway migrations are SQL scripts that define the changes to be applied to your database schema. These scripts should be placed in the `src/main/resources/db/migration` directory of your project. The naming convention for migration files is `V<version>__<description>.sql`, where `<version>` is a version number and `<description>` is a brief description of the migration.

For example, a migration file to create a `users` table might be named `V1__Create_users_table.sql`. The contents of the file could look like this:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('admin', 'admin');
----

You can create multiple migration files, and Flyway applies them in order based on their version numbers. Ideally, each migration file should contain a single change to the database schema, such as creating a table, adding a column, or modifying data.

More information about Flyway migration files can be found in the https://flywaydb.org/documentation/[Flyway documentation].


== Viewing Migration Status

You can view the status of your Flyway migrations in the Control Center UI.

To view the details of the applied migrations, first select the relevant application from the [guilabel]*Application Selector*, as shown in the screenshot here.

Navigate to the [guilabel]*Database* section and select [guilabel]*Migrations*. This displays a list of all applied migrations, including their version numbers and descriptions. You can also see the status of each migration, indicating whether it was successful or failed. If a migration fails, you should review the migration scripts for errors and redeploy the application when they are fixed.
