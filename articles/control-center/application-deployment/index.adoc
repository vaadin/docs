= Deploying an Application with Control Center

Control Center allows you to deploy easily Vaadin applications to a Kubernetes cluster, setting up all the necessary resources and connecting to services such as identity providers. This section explains the steps to prepare and deploy a Vaadin application using Control Center.

Before starting the deployment, the application must be prepared by:

- Adding the Control Center Starter dependency.
- Building a container image for the application.
- Deploying the application via the Control Center UI.


== Control Center Starter Dependency

To ensure your application integrates with Control Center, add the `control-center-starter` dependency to your Maven project. This dependency enables Control Center to manage and monitor your Vaadin application.

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>control-center-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
It's unnecessary to specify the version of this dependency if you are using the Vaadin BOM (Bill of Materials), as it automatically manages versions for all Vaadin dependencies.
====

Once the dependency is added, build your application for production by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
mvn -Pproduction package
----

This generates the production-ready `.jar` file that'll be used in the next step to create a container image.


== Build Container Image

To deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster, you need to create a Docker image. Begin by creating a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project with the following content:

[source,docker]
----
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre
COPY target/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
----

Next, build the Docker image with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker build -t my-app:latest .
----

[NOTE]
====
The `my-app:latest` tag is important because it's used later when deploying the application in Control Center.
====

If you are working with a local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube or Docker Desktop), there is no need to push the image to a container registry. However, if you are deploying to a remote cluster, the image needs to be pushed to a registry like Docker Hub:

[source,shell]
----
docker push company/my-app:latest
----

Make sure you have a Docker account, and that the image is tagged with a proper namespace (e.g., `company/my-app:latest`).


== Deploy with Control Center

Once the container image is ready, the next step is to deploy the application using Control Center.

. Navigate to the **Applications** section in Control Center.
. Select the **Discovery** tab on the left, and then click on the **Deploy** button in the top-right corner of the Application Discovery pane.
. In the **Deploy** panel on the right-hand side (as shown in the screenshot below), fill in the following fields:

image::images/app-deploy.png[App Deployment]

* **Application Name**: Give your application a meaningful name (e.g., `My App`).
* **Image**: Enter the tag of the Docker image (e.g., `my-app:latest`).
* **Replicas**: Specify the number of instances to run (default is `1`).
* **Hostname**: Set the external URL for accessing your application (e.g., `https://app.example.com`). For more information on how to choose a proper hostname, refer to the <<hostname-guidelines, Hostname Guidelines>>.
* **Features**: Enable additional features like Identity Management and Localization if required.

. Once all fields are filled, click **Deploy**.

Control Center now deploys your application to the Kubernetes cluster, create the necessary resources, and handle configurations such as load balancing and service discovery.


== Accessing Application

Once the deployment is complete, your application can be accessed using the hostname you specified during deployment. For example:

- If you deployed in a cloud environment: `https://app.example.com`
- If you are working in a local environment: `http://app.local`

You can now interact with the application in the browser, and it is fully connected to the services and resources provisioned by Control Center.


== Next Steps

After successfully deploying your application, you can now manage it through the Control Center dashboard. To manage the application:

. Use the **Application Selector** to choose your app from the available applications.

Once selected, you can explore the following management options:

- **Identity Management**: Create users, configure groups and roles, and integration with identity providers.
- **Localization**: Upload and manage translations for different languages, enabling a localized experience for your users.

Explore the Control Center's features to further customize and optimize your application in the cluster.
