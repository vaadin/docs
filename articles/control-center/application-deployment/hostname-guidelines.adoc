= Hostname Guidelines

When deploying applications to a Kubernetes cluster, it is important to choose proper hostnames for your applications and services. This section provides guidelines for choosing hostnames for your Control Center applications and services.


== Hostname Necessity

* **External Access**: The hostname acts as the application's URL and makes it accessible from outside the cluster (e.g., via a browser or API calls).
* **Service Communication**: Other services or microservices may need to communicate with your Vaadin application via this hostname.

A valid hostname must resolve to an IP address that can be accessed from the browser or external services.


=== Cloud Environments

If your Kubernetes cluster is hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine, Amazon EKS, Azure AKS), you can set up a DNS record that points to the cluster's public IP.

1. Get the public IP address of your service from your cloud provider's dashboard.
2. Set up a DNS record (e.g., `app.mydomain.com`) pointing to this public IP.

For example, you might use:

[source]
----
https://app.mydomain.com
----

[NOTE]
====
Make sure that your firewall rules or security settings allow external traffic to this IP address on the appropriate ports.
====


=== Local Development & Testing

If you're working with a local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, Docker Desktop), you can use a local hostname and configure your operating system's `hosts` file to resolve it to the loopback address.

**On Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):**

1. Open the `hosts` file with administrative privileges:

[source,bash]
----
sudo nano /etc/hosts
----

2. Add the following line to map `app.local` to your loopback address:

[source,plain]
----
127.0.0.1   app.local
----

**On Windows systems:**

1. Open Notepad as an administrator.
2. Open the `hosts` file located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
3. Add the following line to the file:

[source,plain]
----
127.0.0.1   app.local
----

After editing the `hosts` file, you can access your application locally using the hostname `http://app.local`.

[TIP]
====
Use a consistent hostname throughout your development environment to avoid a misconfiguration.
