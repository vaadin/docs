[CAUTION]
This project is still under active development and is not yet suitable for production use.

Control Center is a specialized tool designed to simplify the management of Vaadin applications on Kubernetes clusters. It provides developers and administrators with an efficient solution to deploy, scale, and manage Vaadin applications effectively, allowing you to focus on development rather than infrastructure complexities.

== Simplified Deployment and Scaling

Deploying Vaadin applications to a Kubernetes cluster can be a complex task involving numerous configurations and resource setups. Control Center streamlines this process by allowing you to deploy it on your cluster with a single command. Once installed, it automatically takes care of installing and configuring all the resources your Vaadin applications need.

Key features include:

* **Effortless Application Deployment**: Easily move production builds of your Vaadin applications to the cluster without manual configurations.
* **Automatic Resource Configuration**: Control Center configures your applications to connect seamlessly with cluster resources.
* **Scaling and Load Balancing**: Run multiple replicas of your applications with built-in load balancing to ensure high availability and optimal performance.

[NOTE]
====
By abstracting the complexities of Kubernetes deployments, Control Center enables you to deploy and scale applications without requiring in-depth Kubernetes expertise.
====

== Comprehensive User Management and Authentication

Security and user management are critical components of any modern application. Control Center enhances your applications by enabling comprehensive user management and authentication features right out of the box.

Key capabilities:

* **Authentication Enforcement**: Configure your applications to require user authentication seamlessly, enhancing security.
* **Intuitive Management Interface**: Use Control Center's user-friendly UI to create and manage users, groups, and roles efficiently.
* **External Identity Provider Integration**: Connect to external identity providers, such as social accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook) or other OpenID Connect providers, offering flexible authentication options to your users.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Increase security by enabling MFA, allowing users to authenticate using an authenticator app for an additional layer of protection.

[TIP]
====
Implementing MFA can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, safeguarding sensitive data within your applications.
====

== Robust Localization Support

Expanding your application's reach to a global audience requires effective localization. Control Center provides robust localization support, simplifying the process of managing translations and ensuring your application resonates with users worldwide.

Features include:

* **Easy Translation Management**: Upload and download translation files, such as those created with Vaadin Copilot, directly through the Control Center UI.
* **Multi-Language Support**: Manage translations for multiple languages, making it straightforward to add or update language support as your audience grows.
* **Live Preview Functionality**: Run a real-time preview of your applications within Control Center to see how translations are applied, ensuring accuracy and consistency across different languages.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Localization not only enhances user experience but also increases user engagement by providing content in users' native languages.
====

== Summary

Control Center offers a comprehensive solution for managing your Vaadin applications on Kubernetes. By handling the complexities of deployment, scaling, user management, and localization, it empowers you to focus on developing and enhancing your applications. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, Control Center streamlines your workflow, allowing you to bring your applications to market faster and more efficiently.
