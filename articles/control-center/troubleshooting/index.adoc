= Troubleshooting

When installing Control Center or deploying an application using Control Center, you may encounter issues that are not caused by Control Center itself, but by external factors such as cluster resource limits, DNS propagation delays, or misconfigured dependencies.


== Insufficient Cluster Resources

When Control Center instance is slow to respond.

=== Solution

- Check resource allocation:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe node
----

- Increase CPU/memory limits.

== DNS Record Propagation Delays

When Control Center's URL or a deployed application's URL is not resolving after being deployed.

=== Solution

Verify DNS records of your domain are ready and available.
To check the IP address a domain resolves to, run:

[source,shell]
----
nslookup <domain>
----

Here's an example of what the above-mentioned command would result for `vaadin.com`:

image::images/nslookup_vaadin.png[dnslookup vaadin.com]

If the lookup cannot resolve the hostname into an IP address, double-check for typos. 
If the DNS server can't find the domain, then it is yet to be propagated.

== Crash Loop

When a deployed application never becomes available because it keeps crashing on startup.
This might be caused due to using an invalid docker image, or by Kubernetes killing a deployment that takes too long to startup thinking it is dead since its liveness probe would not respond successfully.

=== Solution

Double-check the image of the deployed application. If the image is invalid, the deployment won't ever become available.

Check the application logs and make sure they do not show any problematic message.
If a specific error is shown in the logs, address it accordingly.
If no specific error is shown in the logs, check the Kubernetes events in the namespace where Control Center was installed.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl -n <namespace> events
----

If you see events of failing probes, then xref:../application-deployment/index.adoc#deploy-with-control-center[increase the startup delay time] enough to give it time to finish.

== Invalid docker image

A docker image reference consists of several components that describe where the image is stored and its identity. These components are:

```
[HOST[:PORT]/]NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY[:TAG]
```

`HOST` +
Specifies the registry location where the image resides. If omitted, Docker defaults to Docker Hub (`docker.io`).

`PORT` +
An optional port number for the registry, if necessary (for example, `:5000`).

`NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY` +
The namespace (optional) usually represents a user or organization. The repository is required and identifies the specific image. If the namespace is omitted, Docker defaults to `library`, the namespace reserved for Docker Official Images.

`TAG` +
An optional identifier used to specify a particular version or variant of the image. If no tag is provided, Docker defaults to `latest`.

If an invalid docker image is used to deploy an application, the application may never become available.
To check if an unavailable application has an invalid image, look for a Warning event with the message `Failed to pull image...`

[source,shell]
----
kubectl -n <namespace> events --types=Warning
----

image::images/docker_image_not_found.png[Docker image not found]

If the image is hosted in a private repository, you might need to provide an image pull secret as necessary authentication to pull the image.
This value can be provided in the application deploy screen, below the field where the docker image is provided.
