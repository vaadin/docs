= Getting Started with AppSec Kit

AppSec Kit monitors your application dependencies for vulnerabilities. It lets you visualize details on found vulnerabilities and store your analysis to share with other developers.

This is a step-by-step guide on how to use AppSec Kit in an application


=== Add AppSec Kit Dependency

To start, you need to add AppSec Kit as a dependency to your application. For example, to add to a Maven project, do something like this:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>appsec-kit-v8</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Add `cyclonedx-maven-plugin`

To be able to monitor the application dependencies, AppSec Kit needs a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) file. This file contains information about the dependencies and their transitives.

To generate the SBOM file, you need to add the link:https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin[cyclonedx-maven-plugin] to the plugins:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.cyclonedx</groupId>
    <artifactId>cyclonedx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.7</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>makeAggregateBom</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <projectType>library</projectType>
        <schemaVersion>1.4</schemaVersion>
        <includeBomSerialNumber>true</includeBomSerialNumber>
        <includeCompileScope>true</includeCompileScope>
        <includeProvidedScope>true</includeProvidedScope>
        <includeRuntimeScope>true</includeRuntimeScope>
        <includeSystemScope>true</includeSystemScope>
        <includeTestScope>false</includeTestScope>
        <includeLicenseText>false</includeLicenseText>
        <outputReactorProjects>true</outputReactorProjects>
        <outputFormat>json</outputFormat>
        <outputName>bom</outputName>
        <outputDirectory>${project.build.outputDirectory}/resources</outputDirectory>
        <verbose>false</verbose>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

The SBOM file should be generated in the `/resources` sub-directory in the project's output directory. It's a `json` file with the `bom` file name. The plugin is already configured to do it this way.


=== Start the Application

AppSec Kit isn't enabled in production mode. Therefore, you need to start your application in debug mode -- or development mode.

By default, the Vaadin 8 applications start in link:https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/application/application-environment#application.environment.parameters.production-mode[debug mode]. You don't need to enable this, explicitly.

To start the application, execute the following from the command-line:

----
mvn jetty:run
----


=== Open AppSec Kit UI

After the application has started, AppSec Kit analyzes the dependencies, collects the vulnerabilities if any exists, and displays a notification dialog where you can open the UI.
