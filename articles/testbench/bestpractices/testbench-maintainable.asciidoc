[[testbench.maintainable]]
= Creating Maintainable Tests

The first important rule in developing tests is to keep them readable and
maintainable. Otherwise, when the test fail, such as after refactoring the
application code, the developers get impatient in trying to understand them to
fix them, and easily disable them. Readability and maintainability can be
improved with the Page Object Pattern described below.

The second rule is to run the tests often. It is best to use a continuous
integration server to run them at least once a day, or preferably on every
commit.

[[testbench.maintainable.robustness]]
== Increasing Selector Robustness

Robustness of tests is important for avoiding failures because of irrelevant
changes in the HTML DOM tree. Different selectors have differences in their
robustness and it depends on how they are used.

The ElementQuery API uses the logical widget hierarchy to find the HTML
elements, instead of the exact HTML DOM structure. This makes them somewhat
robust, although still vulnerable to irrelevant changes in the exact component
hierarchy of the UI. Also, if you internationalize the application, selecting
components by their caption is not viable.

The low-level XPath selector can be highly vulnerable to changes in the DOM
path, especially if the path is given down from the body element of the page.
The selector is, however, very flexible, and can be used in robust ways, for
example, by selecting by HTML element and a CSS class name or an attribute
value. You can likewise use a CSS selector to select specific components by CSS
class in a robust way.

[[testbench.maintainable.robustness.id]]
=== Using Component IDs to Increase Robustness

To make UIs more robust for testing, you can set a unique __component ID__ for
specific components with [methodname]#setId()#, as described in more detail in
<<dummy/../../creatingtests/testbench-selectors#testbench.selectors.id,"Finding by
ID">>.

Let us consider the following application, in which we set the IDs using a
hierarchical notation to ensure that they are unique; in a more modular case you
could consider a different strategy.


----
public class UIToBeTested extends UI {
    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
        setId("myui");

        final VerticalLayout content = new VerticalLayout();
        content.setMargin(true);
        content.setId("myui.content");
        setContent(content);

        // Create a button
        Button button = new Button("Push Me!");

        // Optional: give the button a unique ID
        button.setId("myui.content.pushmebutton");

        content.addComponent(button);
    }
}
----

After preparing the application this way, you can find the element by the
component ID with the [methodname]#id()# query terminator.


----
// Click the button
ButtonElement button =
    $(ButtonElement.class).id("myui.content.pushmebutton");
button.click();
----

The IDs are HTML element [literal]#++id++# attributes and must be unique in the
UI, as well as in the page in which the UI is running, in case the page has
other content than the particular UI instance. In case there could be multiple
UIs, you can include a UI part in the ID, as we did in the example above.


[[testbench.maintainable.robustness.css]]
=== Using CSS Class Names to Increase Robustness

As a similar method to using component IDs, you can add CSS class names to
components with [methodname]#addStyleName()#. This enables matching them with
the [methodname]#findElement(By.className())# selector, as described in
<<dummy/../../creatingtests/testbench-selectors#testbench.selectors.css,"Finding by
CSS Class">>. You can use the selector in element queries. Unlike IDs, CSS class
names do not need to be unique, so an HTML page can have many elements with the
same CSS class.

You can use CSS class names also in XPath selectors.



[[testbench.maintainable.pageobject]]
== The Page Object Pattern

The Page Object Pattern aims to simplify and modularize testing application
views. The pattern follows the design principle of
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns[separation of
concerns], to handle different concerns in separate modules, while hiding
information irrelevant to other tests by encapsulation.

[[testbench.maintainable.pageobject.defining]]
=== Defining a Page Object

A __page object__ has methods to interact with a view or a sub-view, and to
retrieve values in the view. You also need a method to open the page and
navigate to the proper view.

For example:


----
public class CalculatorPageObject
       extends TestBenchTestCase {
    @FindBy(id = "button_=")
    private WebElement equals;
    ...

    /**
     * Opens the URL where the calculator resides.
     */
    public void open() {
        getDriver().get(
            "http://localhost:8080/?restartApplication");
    }

    /**
     * Pushes buttons on the calculator
     *
     * @param buttons the buttons to push: "123+2", etc.
     * @return The same instance for method chaining.
     */
    public CalculatorPageObject enter(String buttons) {
        for (char numberChar : buttons.toCharArray()) {
            pushButton(numberChar);
        }
        return this;
    }

    /**
     * Pushes the specified button.
     *
     * @param button The character of the button to push.
     */
    private void pushButton(char button) {
        getDriver().findElement(
            By.id("button_" + button)).click();
    }

    /**
     * Pushes the equals button and returns the contents
     * of the calculator "display".
     *
     * @return The string (number) shown in the "display"
     */
    public String getResult() {
        equals.click();
        return display.getText();
    }

    ...
}
----


[[testbench.maintainable.pageobject.findby]]
=== Finding Member Elements By ID

If you have [classname]#WebElement# members annotated with [classname]#@FindBy#,
they can be automatically filled with the HTML element matching the given
component ID, as if done with
[literal]#++driver.findElement(By.id(fieldname))++#. To do so, you need to
create the page object with [classname]#PageFactory# as is done in the following
test setup:


----
public class PageObjectExampleITCase {
    private CalculatorPageObject calculator;

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        driver = TestBench.createDriver(new FirefoxDriver());

        // Use PageFactory to automatically initialize fields
        calculator = PageFactory.initElements(driver,
                         CalculatorPageObject.class);
    }
    ...
----

The members must be typed dynamically as [classname]#WebElement#, but you can
wrap them to a typed element class with the [methodname]#wrap()# method:


----
ButtonElement equals = equalsElement.wrap(ButtonElement.class);
----


[[testbench.maintainable.pageobject.using]]
=== Using a Page Object

Test cases can use the page object methods at business logic level, without
knowing about the exact structure of the views.

For example:


----
@Test
public void testAddCommentRowToLog() throws Exception {
    calculator.open();

    // Just do some math first
    calculator.enter("1+2");

    // Verify the result of the calculation
    assertEquals("3.0", calculator.getResult());

    ...
}
----


[[testbench.maintainable.pageobject.example]]
=== The Page Object Example

You can find the complete example of the Page Object Pattern in the
[filename]#src/test/java/com/vaadin/testbenchexample/pageobjectexample/# folder
in the TestBench Demo. The [filename]#PageObjectExampleITCase.java# runs tests
on the Calc UI (also included in the example sources), using the page objects to
interact with the different parts of the UI and to check the results.

The page objects included in the [filename]#pageobjects# subfolder are as
follows:

* The [classname]#CalculatorPageObject# (as outlined in the example code above)
has methods to click the buttons in the calculator and the retrieve the result
shown in the "display".

* The [classname]#LogPageObject# can retrieve the content of the log entries in
the log table, and right-click them to open the comment sub-window.

* The [classname]#AddComment# can enter a comment string in the comment editor
sub-window and submit it (click the [guilabel]#Add# button).
