[[testbench.execution]]
= Running Tests

During test development, you usually run the tests from your IDE. After that,
you want to have them run by a build system, possibly under a continuous
integration system. In the following, we describe how to run tests by Ant and
Maven.

[[testbench.execution.ant]]
== Running Tests with Ant

Apache Ant has built-in support for executing JUnit tests; you can use the
[literal]#++<junit>++# task in an Ant script to execute JUnit tests. Note that
in earlier versions, you need to enable the support, you need to have the JUnit
library [filename]#junit.jar# and its Ant integration library
[filename]#ant-junit.jar# in the Ant classpath, as described in the Ant
documentation.

The following Ant script allows testing a Vaadin application created with the
Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse. It assumes that the test source files are located
under a [filename]#test# directory under the current directory and compiles them
to the [filename]#classes# directory. The the class path is defined with the
[literal]#++classpath++# reference ID and should contain TestBench and other
necessary libraries.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project default="run-tests">
    <path id="classpath">
        <fileset dir="lib">
            <include name="vaadin-testbench-*.jar"/>
            <include name="junit-*.jar"/>
        </fileset>
    </path>

    <!-- This target compiles the JUnit tests. -->
    <target name="compile-tests">
        <mkdir dir="classes" />
        <javac srcdir="test" destdir="classes"
               debug="on" encoding="utf-8"
        	   includeantruntime="false">
            <classpath>
                <path refid="classpath" />
            </classpath>
        </javac>
    </target>

    <!-- This target calls JUnit -->
    <target name="run-tests" depends="compile-tests">
        <junit fork="yes">
            <classpath>
                <path refid="classpath" />
                <pathelement path="classes" />
            </classpath>

            <formatter type="brief" usefile="false" />

            <batchtest>
                <fileset dir="test">
                    <include name="**/**.java" />
                </fileset>
            </batchtest>
        </junit>
    </target>
</project>
----

You also need to deploy the application to test, and possibly launch a dedicated
server for it.

[[testbench.execution.ant.ivy]]
=== Retrieving TestBench with Ivy

To retrieve TestBench and its dependencies with Ivy in the Ant script, first
install Ivy to your Ant installation, if necessary. In the build script, you
need to enable Ivy with the namespace declaration and include a target for
retrieving the libraries, as follows:


----
<project xmlns:ivy="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant"
         default="run-tests">
...
    <!-- Retrieve dependencies with Ivy -->
    <target name="resolve">
        <ivy:retrieve conf="testing" type="jar,bundle"
            pattern="lib/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]"/>
    </target>

    <!-- This target compiles the JUnit tests. -->
    <target name="compile-tests" depends="resolve">
        ...
----

This requires that you have a " [literal]#++testing++#" configuration in your
[filename]#ivy.xml# and that the TestBench dependency are enabled in the
configuration.

[subs="normal"]
----

&lt;ivy-module&gt;
    ...
    &lt;configurations&gt;
        ...
        **&lt;conf name="testing" /&gt;**
    &lt;/configurations&gt;

    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        ...
        &lt;!-- TestBench 4 --&gt;
        &lt;dependency org="com.vaadin"
                    name="vaadin-testbench-api"
                    rev="latest.release"
                    conf="nodeploy**,testing** -&gt; default" /&gt;
        ...
----
You also need to build and deploy the application to be tested to the server and
install the TestBench license key.



[[testbench.execution.maven]]
== Running Tests with Maven

Executing JUnit tests with Vaadin TestBench under Maven requires defining it as
a dependency in any POM that needs to execute TestBench tests.

A complete example of a Maven test setup is given in the TestBench demo project
available at
link:https://github.com/vaadin/testbench-demo[github.com/vaadin/testbench-demo].
See the [filename]#README# for further instructions.

[[testbench.execution.maven.dependency]]
=== Defining TestBench as a Dependency

You need to define the TestBench library as a dependency in the Maven POM of
your project as follows:


----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
      <artifactId>vaadin-testbench</artifactId>
      <version>4.x.x</version>
    </dependency>
----

For instructions on how to create a new Vaadin project with Maven, please see
<<dummy/../../../framework/getting-started/getting-started-maven#getting-started.maven,"Using
Vaadin with Maven">>.


[[testbench.execution.maven.running]]
=== Running the Tests

To compile and run the tests, simply execute the [literal]#++test++# lifecycle
phase with Maven as follows:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mvn# test
...
-----------------------------------------------------

----
The example configuration starts Jetty to run the application that is tested.

If you have screenshot tests enabled, as mentioned in
<<dummy/../../setup/testbench-installation#testbench.installation.examples,"TestBench
Demo">>, you will get failures from screenshot comparison. The failed
screenshots are written to the [filename]#target/testbench/errors# folder. To
enable comparing them to "expected" screenshots, you need to copy the
screenshots to the [filename]#src/test/resources/screenshots/reference/# folder.
See <<dummy/../../creatingtests/testbench-screenshots#testbench.screenshots,"Taking
and Comparing Screenshots">> for more information regarding screenshots.
