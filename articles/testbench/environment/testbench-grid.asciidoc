= Running Tests in a Distributed Environment

A distributed test environment consists of a test server, a grid hub and a number of test nodes.

The components of a grid setup are illustrated in
<<figure.testbench.architecture>>.

.Vaadin TestBench Grid Setup

The grid hub is a service that handles communication between the JUnit test runner and the nodes.
The hub listens to calls from test runners and delegates them to the grid nodes.
The nodes are services that perform the actual execution of test commands in the browser.
Different nodes can run on different operating system platforms and have different browsers installed.

The hub requires very little resources, so you would typically run it either in the test server or on one of the nodes.
You can run the tests, the hub, and one node all in one host, but in a fully distributed setup, you install the Vaadin TestBench components on separate hosts.

Controlling browsers over a distributed setup requires using a remote WebDriver.

[[testbench.grid.remote]]
== Running Tests Remotely

Remote tests are just like locally executed tests, except instead of using a
browser driver, you use a remote web driver that can connect to the hub. The hub
delegates the connection to a grid node with the desired capabilities, that is,
which browsers are installed in the node.

Instead of creating and handling the remote driver explicitly, as described in
the following, you can use the [classname]#ParallelTest# framework presented in
<<dummy/../testbench-parallel#testbench.parallel,"Parallel
Execution of Tests">>.

An example of remote execution of tests is given in the TestBench demo described
in
<<dummy/../../setup/testbench-installation#testbench.installation.examples,"TestBench
Demo">>. See the [filename]#README.md# file for further instructions.

In the following example, we create and use a remote driver that runs tests in a
Selenium cloud at [uri]#testingbot.com#. The desired capabilities of a test node
are described with a [classname]#DesiredCapabilities# object.


----
public class UsingHubITCase extends TestBenchTestCase {

    private String baseUrl;
    private String clientKey = "INSERT-YOUR-CLIENT-KEY-HERE";
    private String clientSecret = "INSERT-YOUR-CLIENT-KEY-HERE";

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        // Create a RemoteDriver against the hub.
        // In you local setup you don't need key and secret,
        // but if you use service like testingbot.com, they
        // can be used for authentication
        URL testingbotdotcom = new URL("http://" +
                clientKey + ":" + clientSecret +
                "@hub.testingbot.com:4444/wd/hub");
        setDriver(new RemoteWebDriver(testingbotdotcom,
                DesiredCapabilities.iphone()));
        baseUrl = "http://demo.vaadin.com/Calc/";
    }

    @Test
    @Ignore("Requires testingbot.com credientials")
    public void testOnePlusTwo() throws Exception {
        // run the test just as with "local bots"
        openCalculator();
        $(ButtonElement.class).caption("1").first().click();
        $(ButtonElement.class).caption("+").first().click();
        $(ButtonElement.class).caption("2").first().click();
        $(ButtonElement.class).caption("=").first().click();
        assertEquals("3.0", $(TextFieldElement.class)
                            .first().getAttribute("value"));

        // Thats it. Services may provide also some other goodies
        // like the video replay of your test in testingbot.com
    }

    private void openCalculator() {
        getDriver().get(baseUrl);
    }

    @After
    public void tearDown() throws Exception {
        getDriver().quit();
    }
}
----

Please see the API documentation of the [classname]#DesiredCapabilities# class
for a complete list of supported capabilities.

Running the example requires that the hub service and the nodes are running.
Starting them is described in the subsequent sections. Please refer to
link:http://seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.html[Selenium documentation]
for more detailed information.


[[testbench.grid.hub]]
== Starting the Hub

The TestBench grid hub listens to calls from test runners and delegates them to
the grid nodes. The grid hub service is included in the Vaadin TestBench JAR and
you can start it with the following command:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#java# -jar vaadin-testbench-standalone-4.x.x.jar \
       -role hub
----
You can open the control interface of the hub also with a web browser. Using the
default port, just open URL [uri]#http://localhost:4444/#. Once you have started
one or more grid nodes, as instructed in the next section, the "console" page
displays a list of the grid nodes with their browser capabilities.


[[testbench.grid.node-configuration]]
== Node Service Configuration

Test nodes can be configured with command-line options, as described later, or
in a configuration file in JSON format. If no configuration file is provided, a
default configuration is used.

A node configuration file is specified with the [parameter]#-nodeConfig#
parameter to the node service, for example as follows:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#java# -jar vaadin-testbench-standalone-4.x.x.jar
       -role node -nodeConfig [parameter]#nodeConfig.json#
----
See <<testbench.grid.node>> for further details on starting the node service.

[[testbench.grid.node-configuration.format]]
=== Configuration File Format

The test node configuration file follows the JSON format, which defines nested
associative maps. An associative map is defined as a block enclosed in curly
braces ( [literal]#++{}++#). A mapping is a key-value pair separated with a
colon ( [literal]#++:++#). A key is a string literal quoted with double quotes (
[literal]#++"key"++#). The value can be a string literal, list, or a nested
associative map. A list a comma-separated sequence enclosed within square
brackets ( [literal]#++[]++#).

The top-level associative map should have two associations:
[literal]#++capabilities++# (to a list of associative maps) and
[literal]#++configuration++# (to a nested associative map).

[subs="normal"]
----
{
  "capabilities":
    [
      {
        "browserName": "[parameter]##firefox##",
        ...
      },
      ...
    ],
  "configuration":
  {
    "port": 5555,
    ...
  }
}
----
A complete example is given later.


[[testbench.grid.node-configuration.capabilities]]
=== Browser Capabilities

The browser capabilities are defined as a list of associative maps as the value
of the [literal]#++capabilities++# key. The capabilities can also be given from
command-line using the [parameter]#-browser# parameter, as described in
<<testbench.grid.node>>.

The keys in the map are the following:

[parameter]#platform#:: The operating system platform of the test node: [literal]#++WINDOWS++#, [literal]#++XP++#, [literal]#++VISTA++#, [literal]#++LINUX++#, or [literal]#++MAC++#.
[parameter]#browserName#:: A browser identifier, any of: [literal]#++android++#, [literal]#++chrome++#, [literal]#++firefox++#, [literal]#++htmlunit++#, [literal]#++internet explorer++#, [literal]#++iphone++#, [literal]#++opera++#, or [literal]#++phantomjs++# (as of TestBench 3.1).
[parameter]#maxInstances#:: The maximum number of browser instances of this type open at the same time for parallel testing.
[parameter]#version#:: The major version number of the browser.
[parameter]#seleniumProtocol#:: This should be [literal]#++WebDriver++# for WebDriver use.
[parameter]#firefox_binary#:: Full path and file name of the Firefox executable. This is typically needed if you have Firefox ESR installed in a location that is not in the system path.



[[testbench.grid.node-configuration.server]]
=== Server Configuration

The node service configuration is defined as a nested associative map as the
value of the [literal]#++configuration++# key. The configuration parameters can
also be given as command-line parameters to the node service, as described in
<<testbench.grid.node>>.

See the following example for a typical server configuration.

{
  "capabilities":
    [
      {
        "browserName": "[parameter]##firefox##",
        "maxInstances": [parameter]#5#,
        "seleniumProtocol": "[parameter]##WebDriver##",

    "port": 5555,
    "host": ip,
    "register": true,
    "registerCycle": 5000,
    "hubPort": 4444
  }
}
----


[[testbench.grid.node]]
== Starting a Grid Node

A TestBench grid node listens to calls from the hub and is capable of opening a
browser. The grid node service is included in the Vaadin TestBench JAR and you
can start it with the following command:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#java# -jar \
       vaadin-testbench-standalone-4.x.x.jar \
       -role node \
       -hub [parameter]#http://localhost:4444/grid/register#
----
The node registers itself in the grid hub. You need to give the address of the
hub either with the [parameter]#-hub# parameter or in the node configuration
file as described in <<testbench.grid.node-configuration>>.

You can run one grid node in the same host as the hub, as is done in the example
above with the localhost address.

[[testbench.grid.node.os-settings]]
=== Operating system settings

Make any operating system settings that might interfere with the browser and how it is opened or closed.
Typical problems include crash handler dialogs.

On Windows, disable error reporting in case a browser crashes as follows:

. Open "Control Panel > System"

. Select the [guilabel]#Advanced# tab

. Select [guilabel]#Error reporting#

. Check that [guilabel]#Disable error reporting# is selected

. Check that [guilabel]#But notify me when critical errors occur# is not selected

[[testbench.grid.node.screenshot-settings]]
=== Settings for Screenshots

The screenshot comparison feature requires that the user interface of the browser stays constant.
The exact features that interfere with testing depend on the browser and the operating system.

In general:

* Disable blinking cursor

* Use identical operating system themeing on every host

* Turn off any software that may suddenly pop up a new window

* Turn off screen saver


If using Windows and Internet Explorer, you should give also the following setting:

* Turn on [guilabel]#Allow active content to run in files on My Computer# under
[guilabel]#Security settings#


[[testbench.grid.node.browser-capabilities]]
=== Browser Capabilities

The browsers installed in the node can be defined either with command-line parameters or with a configuration file in JSON format, as described in <<testbench.grid.node-configuration>>.

On command-line, you can issue one or more [parameter]#-browser# options to define the browser capabilities. It must be followed by a comma-separated list of property-value definitions, such as the following:


----
-browser "browserName=firefox,version=10,firefox_binary=/path/to/firefox10" \
-browser "browserName=firefox,version=16,firefox_binary=/path/to/firefox16" \
-browser "browserName=chrome,maxInstances=5" \
-browser "browserName=internet explorer,maxInstances=1,platform=WINDOWS"
----

The configuration properties are described in
<<testbench.grid.node-configuration>>.


[[testbench.grid.node.browserdriver]]
=== Browser Driver Parameters

If you use Chrome or Internet Explorer, their remote driver executables must be
in the system path (in the [literal]#++PATH++# environment variable) or be given
with a command-line parameter to the node service:

Internet Explorer:: [parameter]#-Dwebdriver.ie.driver=C:\path\to\IEDriverServer.exe#
Google Chrome:: [parameter]#-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/path/to/ChromeDriver#


[[testbench.grid.mobile]]
== Mobile Testing

Vaadin TestBench includes an iPhone and an Android driver, with which you can
test on mobile devices. The tests can be run either in a device or in an
emulator/simulator.

The actual testing is just like with any WebDriver, using either the
[classname]#IPhoneDriver# or the [classname]#AndroidDriver#. The Android driver
assumes that the hub ( [filename]#android-server#) is installed in the emulator
and forwarded to port 8080 in localhost, while the iPhone driver assumes port
3001. You can also use the [classname]#RemoteWebDriver# with either the
[methodname]#iphone()# or the [methodname]#android()# capability, and specify
the hub URI explicitly.

The mobile testing setup is covered in detail in the Selenium documentation for
both the link:http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/[iOS driver] and the
link:http://selendroid.io/mobileWeb.html[AndroidDriver].
