[[testbench.headless]]
= Headless Testing

TestBench (3.1 and later) supports fully-featured headless testing with
PhantomJS ( http://phantomjs.org), a headless browser based on WebKit. It has
fast native support for various web standards: JavaScript, DOM handling, CSS
selector, JSON, Canvas, and SVG.

Headless testing using PhantomJS allows for around 15% faster test execution
without having to start a graphical web browser, even when performing
screenshot-based testing! This also makes it possible to run full-scale
functional tests on the front-end directly on a build server, without the need
to install any web browsers.

It is usually best to use a graphical browser to develop the test cases, as it
is possible to see interactively what happens while the tests are being
executed. Once the tests are working correctly in a graphical browser, you can
migrate them to run on the PhantomJS headless browser.

[[testbench.headless.running]]
== Basic Setup for Running Headless Tests

The only set up required is to install the PhantomJS binary. Follow the
instructions for your operating system at
link:http://phantomjs.org/download.html[PhantomJS download page], and place the
binary in the system path.

The PhantomJSDriver dependency is already included in Vaadin TestBench.

[[testbench.headless.running.createwebdriver]]
=== Creating a Headless WebDriver Instance

Creating an instance of the [classname]#PhantomJSDriver# is just as easy as
creating an instance of [classname]#FirefoxDriver#.


----
setDriver(TestBench.createDriver(
    new PhantomJSDriver()));
----

Some tests may fail because of the small default window size in PhantomJS. Such
tests are, for example, tests containing elements that pop up and might go
off-screen when the window is small. To make them work better, specify a size
for the window:


----
getDriver().manage().window().setSize(
        new Dimension(1024, 768));
----

Nothing else is needed to run tests headlessly.



[[testbench.headless.grid]]
== Running Headless Tests in a Distributed Environment

Running PhantomJS in a distributed grid is equally easy. First, install
PhantomJS in the nodes by following the instructions in
<<testbench.headless.running>>. Then, start PhantomJS using the following
command:


----
phantomjs --webdriver=8080 \
          --webdriver-selenium-grid-hub=http://127.0.0.1:4444
----

The above will start PhantomJS in the WebDriver mode and register it with a grid
hub running at [literal]#++127.0.0.1:4444++#. After this, running tests in the
grid is as easy as passing [methodname]#DesiredCapabilities.phantomjs()# to the
[literal]#++RemoteWebDriver++# constructor.


----
setDriver(new RemoteWebDriver(
        DesiredCapabilities.phantomjs()));
