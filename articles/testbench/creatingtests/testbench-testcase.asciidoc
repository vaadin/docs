= Creating a Test Case

[[testbench.testcase.setup]]
== Test Setup

Test configuration is done in a method annotated with [literal]#++@Before++#.
The method is executed before each test case.

The basic configuration tasks are:

* Set TestBench parameters
* Create the web driver
* Do any other initialization

[[testbench.development.setup.parameters]]
=== TestBench Parameters

TestBench parameters are defined with static methods in the
[classname]#com.vaadin.testbench.Parameters# class. The parameters are mainly
for screenshots and documented in
<<dummy/../../creatingtests/testbench-screenshots#testbench.screenshots,"Taking and
Comparing Screenshots">>.



[[testbench.testcase.basic]]
== Basic Test Case Structure

A typical test case does the following:

. Open the URL
. Navigate to desired state .. Find a HTML element ( [classname]#WebElement#) for interaction
.. Use [methodname]#click()# and other commands to interact with the element
.. Repeat with different elements until desired state is reached


. Find a HTML element ( [classname]#WebElement#) to check
. Get and assert the value of the HTML element
. Get a screenshot

The [classname]#WebDriver# allows finding HTML elements in a page in various
ways, for example, with XPath expressions. The access methods are defined
statically in the [classname]#By# class.

These tasks are realized in the following test code:


----

@Test
public void basic() throws Exception {
    getDriver().get("http://localhost:8080/tobetested");

    // Find an element to interact upon
    ButtonElement button =
        $(ButtonElement.class).id("mybutton");

    // Click the button
    button.click();

    // Check that the label text is correct
    LabelElement label = $(LabelElement.class).first();
    assertEquals("Thanks!", label.getText());
}
----

You can also use URI fragments in the URL to open the application at a specific
state.

ifdef::web[]
For information about URI fragments, see
<<dummy/../../../framework/advanced/advanced-urifu#advanced.urifu,"Managing URI
Fragments">>.
endif::web[]

You should use the JUnit assertion commands. They are static methods defined in
the [package]#org.junit.Assert# class, which you can import (for example) with:


----
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
----

Please see the
link:http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#selenium-webdriver-api-commands-and-operations[Selenium
API documentation] for a complete reference of the element search methods in the
[classname]#WebDriver# and [classname]#By# classes and for the interaction
commands in the [classname]#WebElement# class.

TestBench has a collection of its own commands, defined in the
[interfacename]#TestBenchCommands# interface. You can get a command object that
you can use by calling [literal]#++testBench(driver)++# in a test case.

While you can develop tests simply with test cases as described above, for the
sake of maintainability it is often best to modularize the test code further,
such as to separate testing at the levels of business logic and the page layout.
See
<<dummy/../../bestpractices/testbench-maintainable#testbench.maintainable,"Creating
Maintainable Tests">> for information about using page objects for this purpose.


[[testbench.testcase.webdriver]]
== Creating and Closing a Web Driver

Vaadin TestBench uses Selenium WebDriver to execute tests in a browser. The
[classname]#WebDriver# instance is created with the static
[methodname]#createDriver()# method in the [classname]#TestBench# class. It
takes the driver as the parameter and returns it after registering it. The test
cases must extend the [classname]#TestBenchTestCase# class, which manages the
TestBench-specific features. You need to store the driver in the test case with
[methodname]#setDriver()#.

The basic way is to create the driver in a method annotated with the JUnit
[literal]#++@Before++# annotation and close it in a method annotated with
[literal]#++@After++#.


----
public class AdvancedTest extends TestBenchTestCase {
    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        ...
        setDriver(TestBench.createDriver(new FirefoxDriver()));
    }
    ...
    @After
    public void tearDown() throws Exception {
        driver.quit();
    }
}
----

This creates the driver for each test you have in the test class, causing a new
browser instance to be opened and closed. If you want to keep the browser open
between the tests, you can use [literal]#++@BeforeClass++# and
[literal]#++@AfterClass++# methods to create and quit the driver. In that case,
the methods as well as the driver instance have to be static and you need to set
the driver in a [literal]#++@Before++# method.


----
public class AdvancedTest extends TestBenchTestCase {
    static private WebDriver driver;

    @BeforeClass
    static public void createDriver() throws Exception {
        driver = TestBench.createDriver(new FirefoxDriver());
    }

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        setDriver(driver);
    }
    ...
    @AfterClass
    static public void tearDown() throws Exception {
        driver.quit();
    }
}
----

[[testbench.development.webdriver.browsers]]
=== Browser Drivers

Please see the API documentation of the [interfacename]#WebDriver# interface for
a complete list of supported drivers, that is, classes implementing the
interface.

Both the Internet Explorer and Chrome require a special driver, as was noted in
<<dummy/../../setup/testbench-installation#testbench.installation.browserdrivers,"Installing
Browser Drivers">>. The driver executable must be included in the operating
system [literal]#++PATH++#, be given with a driver-specific system Java
property:

* Chrome: [parameter]#webdriver.chrome.driver#
* IE: [parameter]#webdriver.ie.driver#

You can set the property in Java with [methodname]#System.setProperty(prop,
key))# or pass it as a command-line parameter to the Java executable with
[parameter]#-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/path/to/driver#.

If you use an ESR version of Firefox, which is recommended for test stability,
you need to the binary when creating the driver as follows:


----
FirefoxBinary binary =
    new FirefoxBinary(new File("/path/to/firefox_ESR_10"));
driver = TestBench.createDriver(
    new FirefoxDriver(binary, new FirefoxProfile()));
