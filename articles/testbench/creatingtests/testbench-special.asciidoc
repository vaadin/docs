[[testbench.special]]
= Special Testing Topics

In the following, we go through a number of TestBench features for handling
special cases, such as tooltips, scrolling, notifications, context menus, and
profiling responsiveness. Finally, we look into the Page Object pattern.

[[testbench.special.waitforvaadin]]
== Waiting for Vaadin

Selenium, on which Vaadin TestBench is based, is originally intended for regular
web applications that load a page that is immediately rendered by the browser.
In such applications, you can test the page elements immediately after the page
is loaded. In Vaadin and other AJAX applications, rendering is done by
JavaScript code asynchronously, so you need to wait until the server has given
its response to an AJAX request and the JavaScript code finishes rendering the
UI. Selenium supports AJAX applications by having special wait methods to poll
the UI until the rendering is finished. In pure Selenium, you need to use the
wait methods explicitly, and know what to use and when. Vaadin TestBench works
together with the client-side engine of Vaadin framework to immediately detect
when the rendering is finished. Waiting is implicit, so you do not normally need
to insert any wait commands yourself.

Waiting is automatically enabled, but it may be necessary to disable it in some
cases. You can do that by calling [methodname]#disableWaitForVaadin()# in the
[interfacename]#TestBenchCommands# interface. You can call it in a test case as
follows:


----
testBench(driver).disableWaitForVaadin();
----

When disabled, you can wait for the rendering to finish by calling
[methodname]#waitForVaadin()# explicitly.


----
testBench(driver).waitForVaadin();
----

You can re-enable the waiting with [methodname]#enableWaitForVaadin()# in the
same interface.


[[testbench.special.tooltip]]
== Testing Tooltips

Component tooltips show when you hover the mouse over a component. Showing them
require special command. Handling them is also special, as the tooltips are
floating overlay element, which are not part of the normal component hierarchy.

Let us assume that you have set the tooltip as follows:


----
// Create a button with a component ID
Button button = new Button("Push Me!");
button.setId("main.button");

// Set the tooltip
button.setDescription("This is a tip");
----

The tooltip of a component is displayed with the [methodname]#showTooltip()#
method in the [classname]#TestBenchElementCommands# interface. You should wait a
little to make sure it comes up. The floating tooltip element is not under the
element of the component, but you can find it by
[literal]#++//div[@class='v-tooltip']++# XPath expression.


----
@Test
public void testTooltip() throws Exception {
    driver.get(appUrl);

    ButtonElement button =
        $(ButtonElement.class).id("main.button");

    button.showTooltip();

    WebElement ttip = findElement(By.className("v-tooltip"));
    assertEquals(ttip.getText(), "This is a tip");
}
----


[[testbench.special.scrolling]]
== Scrolling

((("scrolling")))
Some Vaadin components, such as [classname]#Table# and [classname]#Panel# have a
scrollbar. Normally, when you interact with an element within such a scrolling
region, TestBench implicitly tries to scroll to the element to make it visible.
In some cases, you may wish to scroll a scrollbar explicitly. You can accomplish
that with the [methodname]#scroll()# (vertical) and [methodname]#scrollLeft()#
(horizontal) methods in the respective element classes for the scrollable
components. The scroll position is given in pixels.


----
// Scroll to a vertical position
PanelElement panel = $(PanelElement.class)
        .caption("Scrolling Panel").first();
panel.scroll(123);
----


[[testbench.special.notifications]]
== Testing Notifications

((("[classname]#Notification#", "testing")))
You can find notification elements by the [classname]#NotificationElement# class
in the element query API. The element class supports getting the caption with
[methodname]#getCaption()#, description with [methodname]#getDescription()#, and
notification type with [methodname]#getType()#.

Let us assume that you pop the notifcation up as follows:


----
Button button = new Button("Pop It Up", e -> // Java 8
    Notification.show("The caption", "The description",
                      Notification.Type.WARNING_MESSAGE));
----

You could then check for the notification as follows:


----
// Click the button to open the notification
ButtonElement button =
    $(ButtonElement.class).caption("Pop It Up").first();
button.click();

// Verify the notification
NotificationElement notification =
        $(NotificationElement.class).first();
assertEquals("The caption", notification.getCaption());
assertEquals("The description", notification.getDescription());
assertEquals("warning", notification.getType());
notification.close();
----

You need to close the notification box with [methodname]#close()# to move
forward.


[[testbench.special.contextmenu]]
== Testing Context Menus

((("context menus")))
Opening context menus requires special handling. First, to open a menu, you need
to "context-click" on a specific sub-element in a component that supports
context menus. You can do that with a [methodname]#contextClick()# action in a
[classname]#Actions# object.

A context menu is displayed as a floating element, which is under a special
overlays element in the HTML page, not under the component from which it pops
up. You can find it from the page by its CSS class [literal]#++v-contextmenu++#.
The menu items are represented as text, and you can find the text with an XPath
expression as shown in the example below.

In the following example, we open a context menu in a [classname]#Table#
component, find an item by its caption text, and click it.


----
// Get a table cell to work on
TableElement table = inExample(TableElement.class).first();
WebElement cell = table.getCell(3, 0); // A cell in the row

// Perform context click action to open the context menu
new Actions(getDriver()).contextClick(cell).perform();

// Find the opened menu
WebElement menu = findElement(By.className("v-contextmenu"));

// Find a specific menu item
WebElement menuitem = menu.findElement(
    By.xpath("//*[text() = 'Add Comment']"));

// Select the menu item
menuitem.click();
----


[[testbench.special.timing]]
== Profiling Test Execution Time

It is not just that it works, but also how long it takes. Profiling test
execution times consistently is not trivial, as a test environment can have
different kinds of latency and interference. For example in a distributed setup,
timings taken on the test server would include the latencies between the test
server, the grid hub, a grid node running the browser, and the web server
running the application. In such a setup, you could also expect interference
between multiple test nodes, which all might make requests to a shared
application server and possibly also share virtual machine resources.

Furthermore, in Vaadin applications, there are two sides which need to be
profiled: the server-side, on which the application logic is executed, and the
client-side, where it is rendered in the browser. Vaadin TestBench includes
methods for measuring execution time both on the server-side and the
client-side.

The [interfacename]#TestBenchCommands# interface offers the following methods
for profiling test execution time:

[methodname]#totalTimeSpentServicingRequests()#:: Returns the total time (in milliseconds) spent servicing requests in the
application on the server-side. The timer starts when you first navigate to the
application and hence start a new session. The time passes only when servicing
requests for the particular session. The timer is shared in the servlet session,
so if you have, for example, multiple portlets in the same application
(session), their execution times will be included in the same total.//TODO

roots

+
Notice that if you are also interested in the client-side performance for the
last request, you must call the [methodname]#timeSpentRenderingLastRequest()#
before calling this method. This is due to the fact that this method makes an
extra server request, which will cause an empty response to be rendered.

[methodname]#timeSpentServicingLastRequest()#:: Returns the time (in milliseconds) spent servicing the last request in the
application on the server-side. Notice that not all user interaction through the
WebDriver cause server requests.

+
As with the total above, if you are also interested in the client-side
performance for the last request, you must call the
[methodname]#timeSpentRenderingLastRequest()# before calling this method.

[methodname]#totalTimeSpentRendering()#:: Returns the total time (in milliseconds) spent rendering the user interface of
the application on the client-side, that is, in the browser. This time only
passes when the browser is rendering after interacting with it through the
WebDriver. The timer is shared in the servlet session, so if you have, for
example, multiple portlets in the same application (session), their execution
times will be included in the same total.

[methodname]#timeSpentRenderingLastRequest()#:: Returns the time (in milliseconds) spent rendering user interface of the
application after the last server request. Notice that not all user interaction
through the WebDriver cause server requests.

+
If you also call the [methodname]#timeSpentServicingLastRequest()# or
[methodname]#totalTimeSpentServicingRequests()#, you should do so before calling
this method. The methods cause a server request, which will zero the rendering
time measured by this method.



Generally, only interaction with fields in the __immediate__ mode cause server
requests. This includes button clicks. Some components, such as
[classname]#Table#, also cause requests otherwise, such as when loading data
while scrolling. Some interaction could cause multiple requests, such as when
images are loaded from the server as the result of user interaction.

The following example is given in the
[filename]#link:https://github.com/vaadin/testbench-demo/blob/master/src/test/java/com/vaadin/testbenchexample/VerifyExecutionTimeITCase.java[VerifyExecutionTimeITCase.java]#
file in the TestBench demo.


----
@Test
public void verifyServerExecutionTime() throws Exception {
    // Get start time on the server-side
    long currentSessionTime = testBench(getDriver())
            .totalTimeSpentServicingRequests();

    // Interact with the application
    calculateOnePlusTwo();

    // Calculate the passed processing time on the serve-side
    long timeSpentByServerForSimpleCalculation =
            testBench().totalTimeSpentServicingRequests() -
            currentSessionTime;

    // Report the timing
    System.out.println("Calculating 1+2 took about "
            + timeSpentByServerForSimpleCalculation
            + "ms in servlets service method.");

    // Fail if the processing time was critically long
    if (timeSpentByServerForSimpleCalculation > 30) {
        fail("Simple calculation shouldn't take " +
             timeSpentByServerForSimpleCalculation + "ms!");
    }

    // Do the same with rendering time
    long totalTimeSpentRendering =
            testBench().totalTimeSpentRendering();
    System.out.println("Rendering UI took "
            + totalTimeSpentRendering + "ms");
    if (totalTimeSpentRendering > 400) {
        fail("Rendering UI shouldn't take "
               + totalTimeSpentRendering + "ms!");
    }

    // A normal assertion on the UI state
    assertEquals("3.0",
        $(TextFieldElement.class).first()
        .getAttribute("value"));
}
