= Developing JUnit Tests

JUnit is a popular unit testing framework for Java development. Most Java IDEs,
build systems, and continuous integration systems provide support for JUnit.
However, while we concentrate on the development of JUnit tests in this chapter,
Vaadin TestBench and the WebDriver are in no way specific to JUnit and you can
use any test execution framework, or just regular Java applications, to develop
TestBench tests.

You may want to keep your test classes in a separate source tree in your
application project, or in an altogether separate project, so that you do not
have to include them in the web application WAR. Having them in the same project
may be nicer for version control purposes.

[[testbench.development.basic]]
== Basic Test Case Structure

A JUnit test case is defined with annotations for methods in a test case class.
With TestBench, the test case class should extend the
[classname]#TestBenchTestCase# class, which provides the WebDriver and
ElementQuery APIs.


----
public class MyTestcase extends TestBenchTestCase {
----

The basic JUnit annotations used in TestBench testing are the following:

[literal]#++@Rule++#:: You can define certain TestBench parameters and other JUnit rules with the
[literal]#++@Rule++# annotation.

+
For example, to enable taking screenshots on test failures, as described in
<<dummy/../../../testbench/creatingtests/testbench-screenshots#testbench.screenshots.failure,"Taking
Screenshots on Failure">>, you would define:


+
----
@Rule
public ScreenshotOnFailureRule screenshotOnFailureRule =
        new ScreenshotOnFailureRule(this, true);
----
+
Note that if you use this rule, you must __not__ call
[methodname]#driver.quit()# in your [literal]#++@After++# method, as the method
is executed before the screenshot is taken, but the driver must be open to take
it.

[literal]#++@Before++#:: The annotated method is executed before each test (annotated with
[literal]#++@Test++#). Normally, you create and set the driver here.


+
----
@Before
public void setUp() throws Exception {
    setDriver(new FirefoxDriver());
}
----
+
The driver class should be one of [classname]#FirefoxDriver#,
[classname]#ChromeDriver#, [classname]#InternetExplorerDriver#,
[classname]#SafariDriver#, or [classname]#PhantomJSDriver#. Please check
[classname]#RemoteWebDriver# from API documentation for the current list of
implementations. Notice that some of the drivers require installing a browser
driver, as described in
<<dummy/../../../testbench/setup/testbench-installation#testbench.installation.browserdrivers,"Installing
Browser Drivers">>.

+
The driver instance is stored in the [literal]#++driver++# property in the test
case. While you can access the property directly by the member variable, you
should set it only with the setter.

[literal]#++@Test++#:: Annotates a test method. You normally first open the page and then execute
commands and make assertions on the content.


+
----
@Test
public void testClickButton() throws Exception {
    getDriver().get("http://localhost:8080/myproject");

    // Click the button
    ButtonElement button = $(ButtonElement.class).
            caption("Click Me").first();
    button.click();

    // Check that the label text is correct
    LabelElement label = $(LabelElement.class).first();
    assertEquals("Thanks!", label.getText());
}
----
+
Normally, you would define the URL with a variable that is common for all tests,
and possibly concatenate it with a URI fragment to get to an application state.

[literal]#++@After++#:: After each test is finished, you normally need to quit the driver to close the
browser.


+
----
@After
public void tearDown() throws Exception {
    driver.quit();
}
----
+
However, if you enable grabbing screenshots on failure with the
[classname]#ScreenshotOnFailureRule#, as described in
<<dummy/../../testbench/testbench-screenshots#testbench.screenshots.failure,"Taking
Screenshots on Failure">>, the rules are executed after [literal]#++@After++#,
but the driver needs to be open when the rule to take the screenshot is
executed. Therefore, you should not quit the driver in that case. The rule quits
the driver implicitly.



You can use any other JUnit features. Notice, however, that using TestBench
requires that the driver has been created and is still open.

A complete test case could be as follows:


----
import com.vaadin.testbench.ScreenshotOnFailureRule;
import com.vaadin.testbench.TestBenchTestCase;
import com.vaadin.testbench.elements.ButtonElement;
import com.vaadin.testbench.elements.LabelElement;

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;

import java.util.List;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertFalse;

public class MyprojectTest extends TestBenchTestCase {
    @Rule
    public ScreenshotOnFailureRule screenshotOnFailureRule =
            new ScreenshotOnFailureRule(this, true);

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        setDriver(new FirefoxDriver()); // Firefox
    }

    /**
     * Opens the URL where the application is deployed.
     */
    private void openTestUrl() {
        getDriver().get("http://localhost:8080/myproject");
    }

    @Test
    public void testClickButton() throws Exception {
        openTestUrl();

        // At first there should be no labels
        assertFalse($(LabelElement.class).exists());

        // Click the button
        ButtonElement clickMeButton = $(ButtonElement.class).
                caption("Click Me").first();
        clickMeButton.click();

        // There should now be one label
        assertEquals(1, $(LabelElement.class).all().size());

        // ... with the specified text
        assertEquals("Thank you for clicking",
                $(LabelElement.class).first().getText());

        // Click the button again
        clickMeButton.click();

        // There should now be two labels
        List<LabelElement> allLabels =
            $(LabelElement.class).all();
        assertEquals(2, allLabels.size());

        // ... and the last label should have the correct text
        LabelElement lastLabel = allLabels.get(1);
        assertEquals("Thank you for clicking",
                     lastLabel.getText());
    }
}

This test case stub is created by the Vaadin project wizard in Eclipse and by
the Maven archetype, as described in
<<dummy/../../testbench/testbench-quickstart#testbench.quickstart,"Quick
Start">>.


[[testbench.development.eclipse]]
== Running JUnit Tests in Eclipse

The Eclipse IDE integrates JUnit with nice control features, such as running the
tests in the current test source file. The test results are reported visually in
the JUnit view in Eclipse.

New Vaadin projects created with the Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse contain the
TestBench API dependency, as described in
<<dummy/../../testbench/testbench-quickstart#testbench.quickstart,"Quick
Start">>, so you can run TestBench tests right away.

To configure an existing project for TestBench testing, you need to do the
following:

. Include the TestBench API dependency in the project.

.. If using a project created with the Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse, add the TestBench
API library dependency in [filename]#ivy.xml#. It should be as follows:


+
[subs="normal"]
----
&lt;dependency org="com.vaadin"
            name="vaadin-testbench-api"
            rev="**latest.release**"
            conf="nodeploy-&gt;default"/&gt;
----
+
The TestBench API library provides element classes for Vaadin components, so its
revision number follows the earliest supported Vaadin release. For old Vaadin
versions, you can try using the [literal]#++latest.release++# as given above.

+
The project should contain the [literal]#++nodeploy++# configuration, as created
for new Vaadin projects. See
<<dummy/../../framework/addons/addons-eclipse#addons.eclipse,"Installing Add-ons
in Eclipse with Ivy">> for more details.

.. Otherwise, add the [filename]#vaadin-testbench-api# and
[filename]#vaadin-testbench-core# JARs from the installation package to a
library folder in the project, such as [filename]#lib#. You should not put the
library in [filename]#WEB-INF/lib# as it is not used by the deployed Vaadin web
application. Refresh the project by selecting it and pressing F5.


. Right-click the project in Project Explorer and select [guilabel]#Properties#, and open the [guilabel]#Java Build Path# and the [guilabel]#Libraries# tab. Click [guibutton]#Add JARs#, navigate to the library folder, select the library, and click [guibutton]#OK#.
. Switch to the [guilabel]#Order and Export# tab in the project properties. Make sure that the TestBench JAR is above the [filename]##gwt-dev.jar## (it may contain an old [filename]#httpclient# package), by selecting it and moving it with the [guibutton]#Up# and [guibutton]#Down# buttons.
. Click [guibutton]#OK# to exit the project properties.
. Right-click a test source file and select "Run As > JUnit Test".

A JUnit view should appear, and it should open the Firefox browser, launch the
application, run the test, and then close the browser window. If all goes well,
you have a passed test case, which is reported in the JUnit view area in
Eclipse, as illustrated in <<figure.testbench.development.eclipse>>.

If you are using some other IDE, it might support JUnit tests as well. If not,
you can run the tests using Ant or Maven.
