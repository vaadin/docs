= Installing Web Drivers

Each browser requires a browser specific web driver to be setup before tests can be run.

[TIP]
If you are creating a Maven project, consider using the automated web driver plugin. It will automatically download the drivers you need. See https://github.com/vaadin/testbench-demo for an example

If you want to install the drivers, most of them are available through the package manager (e.g. `brew` or `apt-get`). You can also manually download and install the following drivers yourself:

* GeckoDriver for Firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
* ChromeDriver for Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
* Microsoft web driver for Edge: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
* Selenium IEDriver for IE11: http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html 

[TIP]
Safari drivers are pre-installed on Macs and do not need to be manually installed.

[NOTE]
In many cases the web driver is tied to the browser version. You need to make sure that the combination is a supported one, e.g. ChromeDriver 2.35 only supports Chrome 62-64.

== Adding Web Driver to System Path
The driver executable must be included in the operating system `PATH` or be given to the test using a driver-specific system Java property:

* Google Chrome: `webdriver.chrome.driver`
* Mozilla Firefox: `webdriver.gecko.driver`
* Microsoft Edge: `webdriver.edge.driver`
* Internet Explorer: `webdriver.ie.driver`

In most cases, it is easiest to add it to the `PATH` variable so that it is always available.
