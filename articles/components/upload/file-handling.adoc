= File Handling

The uploading of files may be handled either with Vaadin Flow using Java, or with Hilla using Lit and React. These are described in the two major sections here.


== Handling Uploaded Files in Flow

The Java Flow Upload component provides an API to handle directly uploaded file data, without having to set up an endpoint or a servlet. It uses a [classname]`Receiver` implementation to write the incoming file data into an [classname]`OutputStream`.

The following built-in implementations of [classname]`Receiver` are available:

- [classname]`MemoryBuffer`;
- [classname]`MultiFileMemoryBuffer`;
- [classname]`FileBuffer`; and 
- [classname]`MultiFileBuffer`.

These are described in the sub-sections that follow.


=== MemoryBuffer

The [classname]`MemoryBuffer` can handle a single file upload at once. It does so by writing the file data into an in-memory buffer.

Using [classname]`MemoryBuffer` will configure the component so that only a single file can be selected.

[source,java]
----
MemoryBuffer memoryBuffer = new MemoryBuffer();

Upload upload = new Upload(memoryBuffer);
upload.addSucceededListener(event -> {
    // Read the data from the buffer.
    InputStream fileData = memoryBuffer.getInputStream();

    // Get other information about the file.
    String fileName = event.getFileName();
    String mimeType = event.getMIMEType();
    long contentLength = event.getContentLength();

    // Do something with the file data...
});
----


=== MultiFileMemoryBuffer

The [classname]`MultiFileMemoryBuffer` is the same as [classname]`MemoryBuffer`, but it can handle multiple file uploads at once. It writes the file data into a set of in-memory buffers.

[source,java]
----
MultiFileMemoryBuffer multiFileMemoryBuffer = new MultiFileMemoryBuffer();

Upload upload = new Upload(multiFileMemoryBuffer);
upload.addSucceededListener(event -> {
    // Determine which file was uploaded
    String fileName = event.getFileName();

    // Read the data for that specific file.
    InputStream fileData = multiFileMemoryBuffer
            .getInputStream(fileName);

    // Get other information about the file.
    String mimeType = event.getMIMEType();
    long contentLength = event.getContentLength();

    // Do something with the file data...
});
----


=== FileBuffer

The [classname]`FileBuffer` can handle a single file upload at once. It saves the file on the file system, in the current working directory of the Java application.

Using [classname]`FileBuffer` will configure the component so that only a single file can be selected.

[source,java]
----
FileBuffer fileBuffer = new FileBuffer();

Upload upload = new Upload(fileBuffer);
upload.addSucceededListener(event -> {
    // Get information about the file that was 
    // written to the file system.
    FileData savedFileData = fileBuffer.getFileData();
    String absolutePath = savedFileData.getFile().getAbsolutePath();

    System.out.printf("File saved to: %s%n", absolutePath);
});
----


=== MultiFileBuffer

The [classname]`MultiFileBuffer` works the same as [classname]`FileBuffer`, except that it can handle multiple file uploads at once. For each file, it saves the file on the file system, in the current working directory of the Java application.

[source,java]
----
MultiFileBuffer fileBuffer = new MultiFileBuffer();

Upload upload = new Upload(fileBuffer);
upload.addSucceededListener(event -> {
    // Determine which file was uploaded successfully
    String uploadFileName = event.getFileName();

    // Get information for that specific file
    FileData savedFileData = multiFileBuffer
            .getFileData(uploadFileName);
    String absolutePath = savedFileData.getFile().getAbsolutePath();

    System.out.printf("File saved to: %s%n", absolutePath);
});
----


=== Custom Receiver Implementations

For more advanced use cases, you can provide custom implementations for [classname]`Receiver` or [classname]`MultiFileReceiver`. You might do this, for example, to save files into a specific directory, or to upload them to cloud storage.


== Handling Upload Requests in Lit and React

When using the Upload web component standalone, you'll need an upload file handler or endpoint in your backend to handle the file upload request. By default, the Upload component sends a request with the method type `POST`, the content type `multipart/form-data`, and the request URL (i.e., the current browser location).

Use the `target` attribute to specify a different URL that should handle the upload request. It's also possible to customize other aspects of the request, such as the method or request headers.
