= Upload

// tag::description[]
Upload allows the user to upload files, giving feedback to the user during the upload process.
// end::description[]
It shows the upload progress and the status of each file. Files can be uploaded by clicking on the [guibutton]*Upload* button, or by dragging them onto the component.

== Drag & Drop

Upload allows the user to drag files onto the component to upload them. Multiple files can be dropped simultaneously. By default, this is enabled on desktop computers, and disabled on touch devices. Explicitly setting it to enabled or disabled, though, affects both desktop and mobile devices.

Upload supports uploading folders via drag & drop. This uploads all files from the folder and its sub-folders recursively. The folder structure is flattened and the names of the uploaded files don't indicate in which folder they were in. Uploading folders is currently not supported through the native file picker.

[.example]

== Auto-Upload

By default, files are uploaded immediately -- or at least they're added to the queue to be uploaded. Auto-upload can be disabled, for example, to allow the user to review the list of files before initiating their upload by clicking the &#9654;️ button for each file. Change the button label, though, to indicate that uploads don't start automatically.

[.example]

--

Uploads can be initiated programmatically when auto-upload is disabled. You might do this, for example, if you want to provide the user with a single button to start all uploads.

== Upload Restrictions

You can set three types of restrictions: file format; file count; and file size.

Exceptions that arise -- usually from the user violating any of the imposed restrictions -- aren't shown in the UI by default. Use a <<#listeners, File Rejected listener>> to catch those exceptions and, for example, a <<../notification#, Notification>> to inform the user of the problem, together with any potential solutions.

The user should be informed upfront, though, about any file upload restrictions. Limitations on the maximum number of files allowed, file size, and format should all be communicated clearly, to reduce or eliminate exceptions.


=== File Format

Upload can be configured to accept only files of specific formats. The acceptable file formats are set using MIME type patterns or file extensions (e.g., `"video/*"`, `"image/tiff"` or `".pdf"` and `"audio/mp3"`).

[.example]

----
endif::[]
--


.Prefer MIME Type
[NOTE]
Although https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types[MIME types] are widely supported, file extensions are only implemented https://caniuse.com/input-file-accept[in certain browsers] and should be avoided.

ifdef::flow[]
.File Format Restrictions are Client-Side
[NOTE]
====
File format restrictions set with [methodname]`setAcceptedFileType` method are checked only on the client side. They indicate the hints for users as to what file types to upload.

Using this method won't restrict the uploaded file's format on the server side. The Upload component doesn't have an API to restrict uploaded files by file format or content on the server side. If required, it's the responsibility of the application developer to implement application-specific restrictions on the server side in one or more of the Upload component's event listeners (e.g., in `Upload::addSucceededListener`).
====
endif::[]


=== File Count

By default, Upload doesn't limit the number of files that can be uploaded. However, you can set a file count limit. If you set the maximum to one, the native file browser prevents multiple files from being selected.


.Potential Performance Degradation
[NOTE]
The Upload component has no built-in limit on the number of files that can be uploaded simultaneously. However, performance may degrade after a few hundred files, and browser-specific XHR limitations can cause uploads to fail when attempting to upload more than 2000 files at once.
To ensure reliable operation and good user experience, set a file count limit (for example, around 100).

.Java Flow-Specific
[NOTE]
When using a [classname]`Receiver` that doesn't implement the [interfacename]`MultiFileReceiver` interface -- such as [classname]`MemoryBuffer` or [classname]`FileBuffer` -- the Upload component limits the number of files to one. This is because these receiver implementations only support handling a single file at once.

=== File Size

Upload allows you to limit the file size by setting a maximum amount in bytes. By default, though, there is no limit.

----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-file-size.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

.Revalidate Size Limit on Server
[NOTE]
====
This constraint is set on the client and is checked before contacting the server.

When using Java Flow with Spring Boot, file size limits are also affected by Spring’s multipart configuration.

By default, Spring Boot applies restrictive limits that may cause uploads to fail — typically for files larger than 1MB.
You can increase these limits in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

[source,properties]
----
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=50MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=100MB
----

Additionally, if you're using an [interfacename]`UploadHandler` or [interfacename]`Receiver`, you may need to disable Spring’s multipart resolver entirely to allow the Upload component to handle the stream directly:

[source,properties]
----
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=false
----

By default, Spring intercepts multipart requests and caches the file content before the Upload component receives it.
This behavior can prevent upload event listeners or stream receivers from working correctly.
====


== File Actions

Each file has a certain set of associated actions available, depending on its upload state. A file always has a [guibutton]*Clear/Remove* button. This button cancels the upload if applicable, and removes the file from the list. This button is the only available action during and after a successful upload.

[.example.render-only]
--
ifdef::lit,flow[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-clear-button.ts[render]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-clear-button.tsx[render,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

.Remove the File
[NOTE]
The [guibutton]*Clear/Remove* button doesn't remove a successfully uploaded file from the server file system or database. It's only removed from the file list. Remember to remove the file from the backend.

If an error or exception occurs, Upload displays a [guibutton]*Retry* button for the user to be able to try to upload the file again.

[.example.render-only]
--
ifdef::lit,flow[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-retry-button.ts[render]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-retry-button.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

When a file is queued (i.e., auto-upload is disabled), there's a [guibutton]*Start* Button that the user must press to begin the upload process.

[.example.render-only]
--
ifdef::lit,flow[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-start-button.ts[render]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-start-button.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--


== Internationalization (i18n)

All labels and messages in Upload are configurable. For a complete list of them, see the API documentation (https://vaadin.com/api/platform/{moduleMavenVersion:com.vaadin:vaadin}/com/vaadin/flow/component/upload/UploadI18N.html[Java,role=external,window=_blank] and https://cdn.vaadin.com/vaadin-web-components/{moduleNpmVersion:@vaadin/upload}/#/elements/vaadin-upload#property-i18n[Web component,role=external,window=_blank]).

----
endif::[]

== Customization

You can replace the default upload button. You might do this if Upload needs a stronger emphasis. If so, you can use a primary button.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,html]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-button-theme-variant.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::flow[]
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadButtonThemeVariant.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadExamplesI18N.java[group=Flow]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-button-theme-variant.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

You can also customize the drop label, as well as the icon.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,html]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-drop-label.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::flow[]
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadDropLabel.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-drop-label.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

.Large Drop Target
[TIP]
When customizing the Upload component, make sure not to make the drop target too small. A large drop target is easier to use and less error-prone.


== Listeners

Upload has listeners for the following events:

[.my-xl.term-width-25]
_All Finished_::
Triggered when Upload has processed all of the files in its queue, regardless of whether all uploads were successful.

_File Rejected_::
Sent when the file selected for upload doesn't meet the constraints (e.g., file size limit).

For the following upload events TransferProgressListener should be used, see <<file-handling#add-progress-listener,progress listener>>

_Started_::
TransferProgressListener::onStart

_Finished_ and _Succeeded_::
TransferProgressListener::onComplete

_Progress_::
TransferProgressListener::onProgress

_Failed_::
TransferProgressListener::onError

== Best Practices

With regards to developing with Upload, this section provides some suggestions on how to label buttons and how to construct error messages for better user experiences.


=== Labeling

Choose labels that are informative and instructive. For example, if the user is to upload a single PDF file, it's better to have the button label say "Upload PDF&hellip;" instead of "Upload File&hellip;". The task becomes clearer and improves accessibility for the user -- especially if they're using a screen reader, as the button's label is read aloud when focused.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-labelling.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::flow[]
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadLabelling.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadExamplesI18N.java[group=Flow]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-labelling.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

Likewise, if the user is expected to upload a spreadsheet, but multiple file formats are accepted, label the button, "Upload Spreadsheet". Include helpers to inform the user which formats are accepted.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-helper.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::flow[]
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadHelper.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadExamplesI18N.java[group=Flow]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-helper.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--


=== Error Messages

Try to provide meaningful feedback and error messages when an exception or error occurs. Avoid technical jargon. Instead, try to provide solutions and instructions on how to fix the error.

A "Server Unavailable" message might suffice for tech-savvy users, but for some it might be lacking, unhelpful, and frustrating. Error messages should be written with your users in mind.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-error-messages.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::flow[]
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadErrorMessages.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadExamplesI18N.java[group=Flow]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-error-messages.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

=== Component State

To conserve resources, the files themselves aren't part of the component's server-side state. This has significant implications for component behavior. Removing the Upload component from the layout means that the files in the browser memory are lost. The same applies when reloading the page. Read more about <</components/upload/file-handling#, file handling>>.

The user interface, including the Upload component, should take this into account. For example, if you expect that the user will refresh the page, you can display a message to the user that files needs to be selected again, if this wasn't the first time the page was rendered.
