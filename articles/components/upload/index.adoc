= Upload

// tag::description[]
Upload allows the user to upload files, giving feedback to the user during the upload process.
// end::description[]
It shows the upload progress and the status of each file. Files can be uploaded by clicking on the [guibutton]*Upload* button, or by dragging them onto the component.

== Handling Uploaded Files in Flow

The Java Flow Upload component provides an API to handle directly uploaded file data, without having to set up an endpoint or a servlet. It uses a [classname]`Receiver` implementation to write the incoming file data into an [classname]`OutputStream`.

The following default implementations of [classname]`Receiver` are available:

[.my-xl.term-width-auto]
[classname]`*MemoryBuffer*`::
Handles a single file upload at once. Writes the file data into an in-memory buffer. Using [classname]`MemoryBuffer` configures the component so that only a single file can be selected.

[classname]`*MultiFileMemoryBuffer*`::
Handles multiple file uploads at once. Writes the file data into a set of in-memory buffers.

[classname]`*FileBuffer*`::
Handles a single file upload at once. Saves a file on the system, in the current working directory of the Java application. Using [classname]`FileBuffer` configures the component so that only a single file can be selected.

[classname]`*MultiFileBuffer*`::
Handles multiple file uploads at once. For each, it saves a file on the system, in the current working directory of the Java application.

----
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadFileBuffer.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

For more advanced use cases, you can provide custom implementations for [classname]`Receiver` or [classname]`MultiFileReceiver`. You might do this, for example, to save files into a specific directory, or to upload them to cloud storage.
endif::[]


== Handling Upload Requests Client-Side

When using the Upload web component standalone, you'll need to set up an upload file handler or endpoint in your backend to handle the file upload request. By default, the Upload component sends a request with the method type `POST`, the content type `multipart/form-data`, and the request URL (i.e., the current browser location).

Use the `target` attribute to specify a different URL that should handle the upload request. It's also possible to customize other aspects of the request, such as the method or request headers.

.Web Component Only
[NOTE]
This section is only relevant when using the Upload web component standalone. The Java/Flow component has its own set of APIs to handle file data, directly. It doesn't require the request to be handled manually.

[.example]

  headers='{ "X-API-KEY": "7f4306cb-bb25-4064-9475-1254c4eff6e5" }'>
</Upload>
----
endif::[]
--


== Drag & Drop

Upload allows the user to drag files onto the component to upload them. Multiple files can be dropped simultaneously. By default, this is enabled on desktop computers and disabled on touch devices. Explicitly setting it to enabled or disabled, though, affects both desktop and mobile devices.

[.example]

[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-drag-and-drop.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--


== Auto-Upload

By default, files are uploaded immediately -- or at least they're added to the queue to be uploaded. Auto-upload can be disabled, for example, to allow the user to review the list of files before initiating their upload by clicking the &#9654;Ô∏è button for each file. It's recommended that you change the button label to communicate that uploads don't start automatically.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-auto-upload-disabled.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::flow[]
[source,java]

[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-auto-upload-disabled.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

Uploads can be initiated programmatically when auto-upload is disabled. You might do this, for example, if you want to provide the user with a single button to start all uploads.

----
endif::[]
--


== Upload Restrictions

You can set three types of restrictions: file format; file count; and file size.

Exceptions that arise -- usually from the user violating any of the imposed restrictions -- aren't shown in the UI by default. Use a <<#listeners, File Rejected listener>> to catch those exceptions and, for example, a <<../notification#, Notification>> to inform the user of the problem, together with any potential solutions.

The user should be informed upfront, though, about any file upload restrictions. Limitations on the maximum number of files allowed, file size, and format should all be communicated clearly, to reduce or eliminate exceptions.


=== File Format

Upload can be configured to accept only files of specific formats. The acceptable file formats are set using MIME type patterns or file extensions (e.g., `"video/*"`, `"image/tiff"` or `".pdf"` and `"audio/mp3"`).

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-file-format.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--


.Prefer MIME Type
[NOTE]
Although https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types[MIME types] are widely supported, file extensions are only implemented https://caniuse.com/input-file-accept[in certain browsers] and should be avoided.

ifdef::flow[]
.File Format Restrictions are Client-Side
[NOTE]
====
File format restrictions set with [methodname]`setAcceptedFileType` method are checked only on the client side. They indicate the hints for users as to what file types to upload.

Using this method won't restrict the uploaded file's format on the server side. The Upload component doesn't have an API to restrict uploaded files by file format or content on the server side. If required, it's the responsibility of the application developer to implement application-specific restrictions on the server side in one or more of the Upload component's event listeners (e.g., in `Upload::addSucceededListener`).
====
endif::[]


=== File Count

By default, Upload doesn't limit the number of files that can be uploaded. However, you can set a file count limit. If you set the maximum to one, the native file browser prevents multiple files from being selected.


.Java Flow-Specific
[NOTE]
When using a [classname]`Receiver` that doesn't implement the [interfacename]`MultiFileReceiver` interface -- such as [classname]`MemoryBuffer` or [classname]`FileBuffer` -- the Upload component limits the number of files to one. This is because these receiver implementations only support handling a single file at once.

include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-file-count.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--


=== File Size

Upload allows you to limit the file size by setting a maximum amount in bytes. By default, though, there is no limit.

[.example]

ifdef::lit[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-file-size.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]

[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-file-size.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

.Revalidate Size Limit on Server
[NOTE]
This constraint is set on the client and is checked before contacting the server.


== File Actions

Each file has a certain set of associated actions available, depending on its upload state. A file always has a [guibutton]*Clear/Remove* button. This button cancels the upload if applicable, and removes the file from the list. This button is the only available action during and after a successful upload.

[.example.render-only]
--
ifdef::lit,flow[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-clear-button.ts[render]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-clear-button.tsx[render,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

.Remove the File
[NOTE]
The [guibutton]*Clear/Remove* button doesn't remove a successfully uploaded file from the server file system or database. It's only removed from the file list. Remember to remove the file from the backend.

If an error or exception occurs, Upload displays a [guibutton]*Retry* button for the user to be able to try to upload the file again.

[.example.render-only]
--
ifdef::lit,flow[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-retry-button.ts[render]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-retry-button.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

When a file is queued (i.e., auto-upload is disabled), there's a [guibutton]*Start* Button that the user must press to begin the upload process.

[.example.render-only]
--
ifdef::lit,flow[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-start-button.ts[render]
----
endif::[]

[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-start-button.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--


== Internationalization (i18n)

All labels and messages in Upload are configurable. For a complete list of them, see the API documentation (https://vaadin.com/api/platform/{moduleMavenVersion:com.vaadin:vaadin}/com/vaadin/flow/component/upload/UploadI18N.html[Java,role=external,window=_blank] and https://cdn.vaadin.com/vaadin-web-components/{moduleNpmVersion:@vaadin/upload}/#/elements/vaadin-upload#property-i18n[Web component,role=external,window=_blank]).

== Customization

You can replace the default upload button. You might do this if Upload needs a stronger emphasis. If so, you can use a primary button.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,html]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-button-theme-variant.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]
----

----

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadExamplesI18N.java[group=Flow]

[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-button-theme-variant.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

You can also customize the drop label, as well as the icon.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,html]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-drop-label.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]

----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-drop-label.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

.Large Drop Target
[TIP]
When customizing the Upload component, make sure not to make the drop target too small. A large drop target is easier to use and less error-prone.


== Listeners

Upload has listeners for the following events:

[.my-xl.term-width-25]
_All Finished_::
Triggered when Upload has processed all of the files in its queue, regardless of whether all uploads were successful.

_Failed_::
Occurs when the upload is received, but the reception is interrupted for some reason.

_File Rejected_::
Sent when the file selected for upload doesn't meet the constraints (e.g., file size limit).

_Finished_::
Sent when Upload receives a file, regardless of whether the upload was successful. To distinguish results, use instead either _Succeeded_ or _Failed_ listeners.

_Progress_::
Event for tracking upload progress.

_Started_::
Triggered when the upload starts.

_Succeeded_::
Sent when the upload has been received successfully.



== Best Practices

With regards to developing with Upload, this section provides some suggestions on how to label buttons and how to construct error messages for better user experiences.

=== Labeling

Choose labels that are informative and instructive. For example, if the user is to upload a single PDF file, it's better to have the button label say "Upload PDF&hellip;" instead of "Upload File&hellip;". The task becomes clearer and improves accessibility for the user -- especially if they're using a screen reader, as the button's label is read aloud when focused.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-labelling.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::flow[]
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadLabelling.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadExamplesI18N.java[group=Flow]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-labelling.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--

Likewise, if the user is expected to upload a spreadsheet, but multiple file formats are accepted, label the button, "Upload Spreadsheet". Include helpers to inform the user which formats are accepted.

[.example]
--
ifdef::lit[]
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/upload-helper.ts[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Lit]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::flow[]
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadHelper.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/upload/UploadExamplesI18N.java[group=Flow]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/upload/react/upload-helper.tsx[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=React]
----
endif::[]
--


=== Error Messages

Try to provide meaningful feedback and error messages when an exception or error occurs. Avoid technical jargon. Instead, try to provide solutions and instructions on how to fix the error.

A "Server Unavailable" message might suffice for tech-savvy users, but for some it might be lacking, unhelpful, and frustrating. Error messages should be written with your users in mind.

[.example]
