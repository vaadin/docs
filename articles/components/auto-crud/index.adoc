// tag::description[]
Auto CRUD is a component that provides CRUD functionality (i.e., Create, Read, Update, Delete) based on a Java backend service. It includes a sortable, filterable and lazy-loaded grid, as well as a form for creating, updating and deleting items.

== Basic Usage

Auto CRUD requires a Java service that implements the `CrudService<T, ID>` interface. In the example here, the `EmployeeService` class extends `CrudRepositoryService<T, ID, R>`, which in turn implements the `CrudService<T, ID>`:

[.example]
--
[source,java]
.EmployeeService.java
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/crud/EmployeeService.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
[source,java]
.Employee.java
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/crud/Employee.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
[source,java]
.EmployeeRepository.java
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/crud/EmployeeRepository.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

Hilla generates TypeScript objects for each `@BrowserCallable` service implementing the `CrudService<T, ID>` interface. These TypeScript objects have callable methods that execute the corresponding Java service methods, enabling the Add, Update, and Delete operations as well as lazy data loading with sorting and filtering.

For the example above, the generated TypeScript objects can be imported into the React view and the component configured like so:

[source,tsx]
----
<AutoCrud service={EmployeeService} model={EmployeeModel} />
----

Here's what the rendered component looks like:

As you can see in the previous example, Auto CRUD renders a grid with columns for all of the `Employee` entity's properties, next to a form with fields for editing those properties. Selecting an entity in the grid populates the form with data from that entity. The new button allows one to create a new entity. When submitting the form, the data is submitted to the `save` method of the configured `CrudService`, and the row in the grid is updated. When an existing entity is selected, the form also shows a [guibutton]*Delete* button. Clicking on it, the button calls the `delete` method of the configured `CrudService`, clears the form and removes the row in the grid.

Auto CRUD supports working with plain, non-JPA classes. This can be useful, for example, if you want to use the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern. See the <<working-with-plain-java-classes, Working with Plain Java Classes>> section.


== Component Composition

Auto CRUD is a composition of the following components:

- <<../auto-grid/index.asciidoc#,Auto Grid>>
- <<../auto-form/index.asciidoc#,Auto Form>>

Each of the these components offers some customization options, which are described in the following sections.


== Customizing the Grid

As you may have noticed in the previous example, the Auto CRUD component by default rendered the grid with all the properties of the entity, with default filtering and sorting options. The underlying Auto Grid offers a number of properties that allows you to customize the grid and its columns:

- `visibleColumns`: An array of strings that specifies the names and also the order of appearance for the properties to be displayed as columns in the grid.
- `columnOptions`: An object that specifies the options for each column.
- `customColumns`: An array of `<GridColumn />` components that specifies the custom columns to be added to the grid.
- `noHeaderFilters`: Auto Grid has column-based filtering enabled by default. You can disable the built-in column filters by setting the `noHeaderFilters` flag.
- Grid Props: Since the Auto CRUD component is composed of the Auto Grid component, and it's internally using the <<../grid#,Grid component>>, you can use all the properties of the Grid component to customize the grid. The way to pass the properties to the Auto CRUD component is by using the `gridProps` property.

You can customize the grid by providing any of these options to the `gridProps` property. The following example shows how to provide the `visibleColumns` property to the `gridProps` to set the visibility and order of the columns. Additionally, it shows how to provide the `columnOptions` property to the `gridProps` to change the default header title of `firstName` column, and to provide a custom renderer for the `active` column.

.Don't Expose Sensitive Data on Client-Side
[CAUTION]
When using Auto CRUD, it's important to check that you don't expose sensitive data to the client-side. For example, if you have a `password` property in your entity, hiding it using the `visibleColumns` property won't prevent the data from being sent to the client-side. Make sure your service implementation doesn't expose sensitive data to the client-side. You could do this by using a `@JsonIgnore` annotation on the property.

For more detailed examples of customizing the underlying grid, please refer to the <<../auto-grid/index.asciidoc#,Auto Grid>> component documentation.


== Customizing the Form

As you may have seen in the previous examples, Auto CRUD component renders by default a form with input components for all properties of the `Employee` entity along with a [guibutton]*Save* button that associates with the respective `save` method of the provided `CrudService<Employee, Long>`. It also includes a [guibutton]*Discard* button -- which is hidden initially -- that calls the form binder's `reset` operation, which is only visible when there are changes. It renders a [guibutton]*Delete* button when a row is selected in the Grid, and the Form is in edit mode.

The underlying Auto Form offers a number of properties that allows you to customize the form and its fields:

- `visibleFields`: Auto Form component renders by default fields for all data properties in a Form Layout, except for the fields annotated by `@Id` and `@Version`. Using `visibleFields`, you can choose which fields to render in the form and in what order.

- `fieldOptions`: This is an object that specifies the options for each field.
- `colspan`: In case you want to render the form in a two or more column layout, you can set the `colspan` property for each field through `fieldOption` props to make it span over more than one column.
- `formLayoutProps`: This is an object that specifies the options for the Form Layout.
- `layoutRenderer`: This is a function that takes the `AutoFormLayoutRendererProps` as a parameter and returns any React element. The `AutoFormLayoutRendererProps` contains a _read-only list of bound fields_ called `children`, and _the form binder instance_ called `form`. You can use this function to achieve any custom layout, and also to have more control over binding and validations.

You can customize the form rendered by Auto CRUD by providing any of these options the `formProps` property. The example below shows how to provide the `visibleFields` property to the `formProps` to set the visibility and the order of the fields. Additionally, it shows how to provide the `fieldOptions` property to the `formProps` to change the default label of `firstName` field, and to render a Text Area for the `description` field:

.Don't Expose Sensitive Data on Client-Side
[CAUTION]
When using Auto CRUD, it's important to check that you don't expose sensitive data to the client-side. For example, if you have a `password` property in your entity, hiding it using `visibleFields` does not prevent the data from being sent to the client-side. Make sure your service implementation doesn't expose sensitive data to the client-side. You could do this by using a `@JsonIgnore` annotation on the property.

For more detailed examples of customizing the underlying form, please refer to the <<../auto-form/index.asciidoc#,Auto Form>> component documentation.


== Working with Plain Java Classes

Auto CRUD supports working with plain, non-JPA Java classes. This can be useful, for example, if you want to use the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern to decouple your domain from your presentation logic, or you want to avoid serializing your JPA entities to the client due to performance concerns.


=== Implementing a Custom Service

To use plain Java classes, you need to provide a custom implementation of the `CrudService<T>` interface, as the `CrudRepositoryService<T>` base class only works with JPA entities. The following methods have to be implemented:

- `List<T> list(Pageable pageable, Filter filter)`: Returns a list of paginated, sorted and filtered items.
- `T save(T value)`: Either creates a new item or updates an existing one, depending on whether the item has an ID or not. Returns the saved item.
- `void delete(ID id)`: Deletes the item with the given ID.

The following example shows a basic implementation of a custom `CrudService` that wraps a JPA repository. The service only exposes DTO instances to the client and maps between the DTO instances and JPA entities, internally.

The example above only has a very basic implementation of the `list` method. It doesn't support sorting and filtering. For a proper implementation of that method, see the corresponding section in the <<../auto-grid#implementing-a-custom-service,Auto Grid>> documentation. It shows how to implement a `ListService`, in which the `list` method has the same signature as for `CrudService`.
