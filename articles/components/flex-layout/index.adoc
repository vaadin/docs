= Flex Layout

// tag::description[]
Flex Layout arranges components in a row or a column. Each item can expand to fill the available space or shrink to fit smaller containers.
// end::description[]
It leverages the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox[CSS Flexbox] layout model
to provide flexible and responsive positioning of child components.

On the client side, Flex Layout is represented by a simple `div` element with `display: flex`.
Since no additional client-side logic is required, there is no corresponding web component implementation.

The Flow API provides convenient constants and methods that make Flex Layout configuration straightforward and intuitive.

include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/flexlayout/FlexLayoutBasic.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----

By default, Flex Layout arranges its items in a single horizontal row without wrapping.
This behavior corresponds to the CSS `flex-wrap` property, which can be easily customized through the API.


== Direction

By default, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox[CSS Flexbox] arranges items horizontally in a row.
You can change this behavior by setting a different direction, which corresponds to the CSS `flex-direction` property.

|===
|Value |Description

|`ROW`
|Items are arranged horizontally in a row.

|`ROW_REVERSE`
|Items are arranged horizontally in reverse order.

|`COLUMN`
|Items are arranged vertically in a column.

|`COLUMN_REVERSE`
|Items are arranged vertically in reverse order.

|===


== Wrap Mode

You can control how items behave when they don’t fit into a single line by setting the wrap mode.
This corresponds to the CSS `flex-wrap` property.

include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/flexlayout/FlexLayoutWrap.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----

|===
|Value |Description

|`NOWRAP`
|Items remain on a single line and may overflow the container if there isn't enough space.

|`WRAP`
|Items wrap onto multiple lines if they don't fit into a single row or column.

|`WRAP_REVERSE`
|Items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order when they don’t fit into a single row or column.

|===


== Content Alignment


You can control how multiple lines of items are spaced apart from each other by setting the content alignment.
This corresponds to the CSS `align-content` property.

include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/flexlayout/FlexLayoutContentAlignment.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]

|===
|Value |Description

|`START`
|Lines of items are packed at the start of the container.

|`END`
|Lines of items are packed at the end of the container.

|`CENTER`
|Lines of items are packed in the center of the container.

|`STRETCH`
|Lines of items stretch to fill the remaining space in the container.

|`SPACE_BETWEEN`
|Lines of items are distributed evenly inside the container. The first line is at the start, and the last line is at the end.

|`SPACE_AROUND`
|Lines of items are distributed evenly inside the container, with equal space around each line.

|===

== Item Alignment

=== Along the Layout Direction

You can control how items are distributed along the main layout direction (horizontally or vertically, depending on the chosen direction) by setting the content justification.
This corresponds to the CSS `justify-content` property.

|===
|Value |Description

|`START`
|Items are placed at the start of the container.

|`END`
|Items are placed at the end of the container.

|`CENTER`
|Items are placed at the center of the container.

|`BETWEEN`
|Items are distributed evenly, with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.

|`AROUND`
|Items are distributed evenly, with equal space before, between, and after each item.

|`EVENLY`
|Items are distributed with equal space around them.

|===


=== Across the Layout Direction

You can control how items are aligned perpendicular to the layout direction (vertically or horizontally, opposite of the chosen direction) by setting the item alignment. This corresponds to the CSS `align-items` property.

Individual items can override the layout’s alignment setting using the `align-self` property.

|===
|Value |Description

|`START`
|Items are aligned at the start of the container.

|`END`
|Items are aligned at the end of the container.

|`CENTER`
|Items are aligned in the center of the container.

|`STRETCH`
|Items stretch to fill the container vertically (or horizontally, opposite of the chosen direction).

|`BASELINE`
|Items are aligned so that their text baselines line up.

|`AUTO`
|Items use the container’s `align-items` value, or `stretch` if no parent alignment is defined.

|===


== Item Order

You can control the order in which components appear inside a Flex Layout.
The order value defines a component’s position relative to the other components within the same layout.

This corresponds to the CSS `order` property. The default value is `0`.
Setting a component’s order back to `0` removes any custom ordering and restores the natural DOM order.

== Flex Basis

You can define the initial size of a component along the layout’s main axis by setting its flex basis.
This corresponds to the CSS `flex-basis` property.

== Flex Grow / Shrink

You can control how components expand or shrink to fill the available space within a Flex Layout.
These settings correspond to the CSS `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` properties.

The `flex-grow` property defines how much a component expands relative to other components when there is extra space available.
The `flex-shrink` property defines how much a component contracts relative to others when there is not enough space.
