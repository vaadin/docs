== Scroll Direction
Scroller has four different scroll directions: *vertical*, *horizontal*, *both*, and *none*.
Scroller's default scroll direction is *both*.

=== Vertical
When the scroll position is vertical, the user can scroll vertically if the content overflows the container vertically.
Content that overflows horizontally is clipped and inaccessible, so the width of the content should be 100%.

=== Horizontal
When the scroll position is horizontal, the user can scroll horizontally if the content overflows the container horizontally.
Content that overflows vertically is clipped and inaccessible, so the height of the content should be 100%.

[NOTE]
====
Use horizontal scrolling with caution, as it's much less common and may be difficult for users to recognize and use, in particular on non-mobile devices.
====

==== Desktop
Excluding Grids, horizontal scrolling isn't commonly used in desktop and/or business applications, as it can be non-obvious and cumbersome to use.

It's recommended to use Buttons to help users notice and navigate horizontally scrollable sections.
For horizontally scrollable lists, it's considered good practice to display the number of items there are in the list, and which items the user is currently viewing.

==== Mobile
Scrolling horizontally or swiping is more common on mobile, for example for navigation purposes.
It can also be used to conserve vertical space, for example in situations where the user is exploring less-important information, such as shortcuts or images.

=== Both
When the scroll position is *Both* (default), the user can scroll vertically and horizontally if the content overflows in both directions.

This scroll direction is best suited to allowing the user to pan around large elements, such as images.
It can also be used as a fallback for a responsive layout that can't be guaranteed not to overflow in some situations.

=== None
Use *None* to hide content that overflows in either direction.
No scrollbars are available to the user to access the clipped content.
*None* can be used in fixed-size/fixed-layout situations, where overflow would cause issues.
