.Map Data Subscription Not Included
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Map component uses OpenStreetMap as its default map data provider for testing and development purposes.
The https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/[tile usage policy for OpenStreetMap] only allows for light usage. This means it should not be used for production.
A commercial map data service, or a self-hosted solution, should be arranged for production use.
See the <<Map Sources>> section for a list of supported map data formats.
====


== Viewport

Map provides interactions, controls, and APIs to control the viewport.
This includes setting the center, the zoom level, and the rotation.

By default, map coordinates such as the view's center are specified in EPSG:4326 projection -- also known as latitude and longitude -- unless a custom user projection is configured.
See <<#coordinate-systems, Coordinate Systems>> for more information.

The zoom level is a decimal number that starts at `0` as the most zoomed-out level, and then progressively increases to zoom further in.
By default, the maximum zoom level is currently restricted to `28`.
In practical terms, the level of detail of the map data that a map service provides will determine the usefulness of higher zoom levels.

[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V25.0"]
=== Zoom to Fit

The `zoomToFit` method can be used to automatically adjust the viewport so that a given list of features are visible within the viewport. The method takes an optional padding parameter that can be used to add some space between the features and the edge of the viewport, as well as a parameter for controlling the animation duration.

[.example]
--
[source,java]
----
List<Feature> features = ...; // Get a list of map features

map.zoomToFit(features, 50, 1000); // 50px padding, 1 second animation
----
--

== Map Sources

Web maps can be roughly categorized as being based on tiled images, full images or vector data.
Each category comes with its own set of standards and formats that define how the map data is structured and how it should be used.
Map services are applications -- typically servers or cloud services -- that provide map data in one or more of these formats.

The Map component provides various sources for loading map data in a specific format from a map service.
Each source requires the use of a specific type of layer that can render data from that source.

The following table lists the sources that can be used with Map.
An example usage of each source can be found in the demo that follows:

// Allow OSM, WMS, XYZ
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Abbr = NO -->]

== Layers

The map component is preconfigured with a background layer showing a map from the OpenStreetMap service by default, as well as a feature layer for quickly adding geographical features, such as markers.
The default background layer can be replaced, and additional layers added on top of it, such as to display overlays.

By default, layers are rendered in the order that they were added to the map, with the first-added layer rendered first, and the last-added layer rendered last.
For finer-grain control of the layer rendering order, a `z-index` can be defined for each layer.
Layers with a higher z-index are rendered on top of layers with a lower z-index.
The exceptions are the background layer, which is always rendered first, and the feature layer, which is rendered with a z-index of `100`, by default.

The visibility of layers can be toggled, which can be an alternative to adding and removing them, dynamically.
For map overlays, a layer can be configured with a lowered opacity so that the background layer is still semi-visible below the overlay.
Some map services may provide map data with a lowered opacity by default.

The following example demonstrates how to replace the background layer, how to add several overlays to the map, and how to control their visibility:

== Markers

Markers can be displayed on top of a map to show points of interest, such as addresses, buildings, vehicles, or any other entity.
A marker is defined by a coordinate and an icon.
Icons can be configured as either a URL or using a <<{articles}/flow/advanced/downloads#download-content-from-inputstream,DownloadHandler>>.
If no custom icon is provided, the marker uses a default icon.

By default, map coordinates such as a marker's location are specified in EPSG:4326 projection, also known as latitude and longitude, unless a custom user projection is configured.
See <<#coordinate-systems, Coordinate Systems>> for more information.

----
endif::[]
--

.Performance considerations
[NOTE]
====
When using custom icons, ensure that you create only one icon instance per custom image that you want to use.
For example, when adding multiple markers that use the same image, it's sufficient to create one icon instance and use that for all markers.
Creating a separate icon instance for each marker can increase memory usage and degrade performance in the browser.
====

[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.1"]
=== Marker Text

Markers can be configured to show text, which is displayed below the marker icon by default.
You can customize the position and style of the text by setting a custom text style for the marker.

[.example]

[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/map/map-marker-text.ts[preimport,hidden]
----

ifdef::flow[]

----
endif::[]
--

[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.1"]
=== Marker Drag & Drop

Markers can be configured to be draggable, allowing users to pick them up and move them around the map.
Use `MapFeatureDropEvent` to show a notification when a marker is dragged to a new location. The notification shows which marker was moved along with its start and end coordinates.
The coordinates are automatically updated for the marker.

The following example demonstrates how you can drag a marker on the map and get notified when dropping it into place:

[.example]

----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/map/map-marker-drag-drop.ts[preimport,hidden]
----

----
endif::[]
--

[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.8"]
== Polygons

Polygons can be used to highlight areas on the map, such as geographical features, zones or corridors. A polygon is defined by a list of coordinates that form a linear ring, where the first and the last coordinate must be equivalent. Additional linear rings can be passed to define holes in the polygon. Polygons support the same features as markers, such as text labels, click events and drag-and-drop.

[NOTE]
====
Polygon text labels are only rendered if they visually fit inside the polygon at the current zoom level.
====

----
endif::[]
--

[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V25.0"]
== Clusters

When displaying a large number of markers on the map, it can be useful to group nearby markers into clusters to improve readability and performance. Clusters are represented by a single icon that shows the number of markers it contains. When zooming in, clusters are automatically expanded to show the individual markers.

[.example]
--
[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/map/map-clusters.ts[preimport,hidden]
----

ifdef::flow[]
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/component/map/MapClusters.java[render,tags=snippet,indent=0,group=Flow]
----
endif::[]
--

The clustering behavior can be configured using the following properties on the `FeatureLayer` class:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Property | Description
| `clusterDistance` | Sets the distance in pixels within which features should be clustered.
| `clusterMinDistance` | Minimum distance in pixels between generated clusters.
|===

=== Styling Clusters

Clusters are rendered using a default icon of a circle that contains a text with the number of features in the cluster. The cluster icon and text can be customized by setting a custom cluster style like so:

[.example]
--
[source,java]
----
import com.vaadin.flow.component.map.configuration.style.Icon;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.map.configuration.style.Style;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.map.configuration.style.TextStyle;
import com.vaadin.flow.server.streams.DownloadHandler;

// Assuming the given image is in the JAR resources
DownloadHandler downloadHandler = DownloadHandler.forClassResource(
        getClass(), "/META-INF/resources/frontend/custom-cluster.png",
        "custom-cluster.png").inline();
Icon.Options iconOptions = new Icon.Options();
iconOptions.setImg(downloadHandler);
iconOptions.setImgSize(new Icon.ImageSize(88, 88));
iconOptions.setScale(0.5f);
Icon clusterIcon = new Icon(iconOptions);

TextStyle textStyle = new TextStyle();
textStyle.setFont("bold 14px sans-serif");
textStyle.setOffset(0, 0);

Style customStyle = new Style();
customStyle.setImage(clusterIcon);
customStyle.setTextStyle(textStyle);

map.getFeatureLayer().setClusterStyle(customStyle);
----
--

== Events

The Map component provides several events that can be used to make a map interactive.
Currently, the following events are supported:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Event | Description

|https://vaadin.com/api/platform/{moduleMavenVersion:com.vaadin:vaadin}/com/vaadin/flow/component/map/events/MapViewMoveEndEvent.html[View Move End]
|Triggered after the user has changed the viewport, regardless of the input method.
The event is triggered only after the user has finished manipulating the viewport. For example, it's triggered after letting go of the mouse button after a mouse drag action.

The event contains details about the current viewport, such as the center, the zoom level, and the current bounding box, the extent of the viewport.

|https://vaadin.com/api/platform/{moduleMavenVersion:com.vaadin:vaadin}/com/vaadin/flow/component/map/events/MapClickEvent.html[Map Click]
|Triggered when the user clicks on the map.
The event contains information about the clicked coordinates and other details of the mouse event.
It also contains a list of all features at that location to distinguish whether the click occurred on the map itself, or on a feature.

|https://vaadin.com/api/platform/{moduleMavenVersion:com.vaadin:vaadin}/com/vaadin/flow/component/map/events/MapFeatureClickEvent.html[Feature Click]
|Triggered when the user clicks on a feature, such as a marker or polygon.
The event contains information about the clicked feature and other details of the mouse event.
If there are overlapping features, the event is fired only for the top-level feature at that location.

The term _feature_ refers to geographical features in a general sense.

|https://vaadin.com/api/platform/{moduleMavenVersion:com.vaadin:vaadin}/com/vaadin/flow/component/map/events/MapClusterClickEvent.html[Cluster Click]
|Triggered when the user clicks on a cluster.
The event contains information about all features grouped into the cluster and other details of the mouse event.

|===

The following example demonstrates how to make use of events in general:

[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V23.2"]
== Coordinate Systems

The default coordinate system, or projection, for all coordinates passed to or received from the component is EPSG:4326, also referred to as GPS coordinates or latitude and longitude.
This is called the user projection as it affects all of the coordinates that the user of the component, in this case the developer, is working with.
That means when setting coordinates, such as for the viewport or for a marker, coordinates must be specified in EPSG:4326 by default. Coordinates received from events are guaranteed to be in that projection.

Internally, the component converts all of the coordinates into the projection that's used by the map's view. This is called the view projection.
The default view projection is EPSG:3857, also known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection[Web Mercator Projection].

=== Changing the User Projection

The user projection can be changed, for example when working with coordinates that aren't in the EPSG:4326 projection.
Out of the box, the component only has support for the EPSG:4326 and EPSG:3857 projections. However, the component allows <<#defining-custom-projections, defining custom projections>>.
As mentioned above, changing the user projection affects all coordinates. Using coordinates with different projections isn't supported.

.Example for setting a different user projection
[.example]
--
[source,Java]
----
// Set user projection to EPSG:3857
Map.setUserProjection("EPSG:3857");

// Create a map, center viewport on New York using
// coordinates in EPSG:3857 projection
Map map = new Map();
map.setCenter(new Coordinate(-8235375.352932, 4967773.457877));
map.setZoom(10);
----
--

.User Projection Scope
[NOTE]
====
The user projection setting is valid for the lifetime of the current browser page. This means it stays defined when navigating using the router, but not when doing a hard location change, or reloading the page.
In practice, it's advisable to set the user projection on every page where it's used.

The user projection affects all maps on the browser page, and should be set before creating any maps.
====

=== Defining Custom Projections

Custom projections can be defined when working with coordinates that are in neither EPSG:4326 nor EPSG:3857 projection.
Defining a custom projection requires a name, which can later be referenced, as well as a projection definition in the https://www.iso.org/standard/76496.html[Well Known Text] (WKT) format.
https://epsg.io[epsg.io] is a handy resource for looking up WKT definitions of projections, as well as converting coordinates between specific projections. After a custom projection has been defined, it can be used as either user projection or view projection.

.Example for defining a custom projection
[.example]
--
[source,Java]
----
// Define EPSG:3067, which is a projection specifically for use in Finland
String wkt = ""
    + "PROJCS[\"ETRS89 / TM35FIN(E,N)\",\n"

    + "    AXIS[\"Easting\",EAST],\n"
    + "    AXIS[\"Northing\",NORTH],\n"
    + "    AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"3067\"]]";
Map.defineProjection("EPSG:3067", wkt);

// Set user projection to EPSG:3067
Map.setUserProjection("EPSG:3067");

// Create a map, change view projection to EPSG:3067 as well
Map map = new Map();
map.setView(new View("EPSG:3067"));

// Center viewport on Helsinki using
// coordinates in EPSG:3067 projection
map.setCenter(new Coordinate(385725.63, 6671616.89));
map.setZoom(10);

.Custom projection scope
[NOTE]
====
Custom projections are valid for the lifetime of the current browser page. This means they stay defined when navigating using the router, but not when doing a hard location change, or reloading the page.
In practice, it's advisable to define projections on every page where they are used.

Custom projections must be defined before using them as either user projection or view projection.
====


== Theme Variants

=== Borderless

By default, Map has a visible, rounded border.
The border can be removed by using the `borderless` theme variant.
