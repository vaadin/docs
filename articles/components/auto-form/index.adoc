== Basic Usage

Auto Form requires a Java service that implements the `CrudService<T, ID>` interface. In the example here, the `EmployeeService` class extends `CrudRepositoryService<T, ID, R>`, which in turn implements the `CrudService<T, ID>`:

[.example]
--
[source,java]
.EmployeeService.java
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/crud/EmployeeService.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
[source,java]
.Employee.java
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/crud/Employee.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
[source,java]
.EmployeeRepository.java
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/crud/EmployeeRepository.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

Hilla generates TypeScript objects for each `@BrowserCallable` service implementing the `CrudService<T, ID>` interface. These TypeScript objects have callable methods that execute the corresponding Java service methods, enabling the Add, Update, and Delete operations, as well as lazy data loading with sorting and filtering.

For the example above, you can import the generated TypeScript objects in your React view and configure the component like so:

[source,tsx]
----
<AutoForm service={EmployeeService} model={EmployeeModel} />
----

Here's how the rendered form would look:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-basic.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

As you can see, Auto Form component renders a form with fields for all properties of the `Employee` entity. When submitting the form, the data is automatically submitted to the `save` method of the configured `CrudService`.

Auto Form supports working with plain, non-JPA classes. This can be useful, for example, if you want to use the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern. See the <<working-with-plain-java-classes, Working with Plain Java Classes>> section for more on this.

.Default Responsive Breakpoints
[NOTE]
Auto Form uses the <<../form-layout#,Form Layout component>>'s  default responsive breakpoints. To learn how to customize them, see the <<customizing-form-layout,Customizing Form Layout>> section.


== Customizing Visibility & Order

Auto Form renders by default input fields for all properties of the entity in a Form Layout with a two-column layout, except for the properties annotated by `@Id` and `@Version`. You can customize the visibility and the order of fields using `visibleFields` property:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-field-visibility.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

.Don't Expose Sensitive Data on Client-Side
[CAUTION]
When using Auto Form, it's important to check that you don't expose sensitive data to the client-side. For example, if you have a `password` property in your entity, hiding it using `visibleFields` doesn't prevent the data from being sent to the client-side. Make sure your service implementation doesn't expose sensitive data to the client-side. You could do this by using a `@JsonIgnore` annotation on the property.


== Customizing Field Properties

You can customize the properties of the fields rendered by Auto Form by using the `fieldOptions` property.


=== Overriding Field Options

You can customize some options of the automatically rendered fields by Auto Form by using the `fieldOptions` property.


==== Customizing Field Label

To customize the label of a field, use the `label` property of the `fieldOptions` property as follows:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-field-custom-label.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

The previous example shows how to customize the label of the `firstName` and `lastName` fields.


==== Customizing Field Column Span

As Auto Form component uses the Form Layout component as the layout, you can customize the `colspan` property of the fields rendered by Auto Form, with the `fieldOptions` property as follows:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-field-colspan.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--


==== Customizing Input Component

You can use the `renderer` property of the `fieldOptions` to override the rendered field by Auto Form. The following example shows how to render a Text Area component for the description field:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-field-custom-renderer.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--


== Customizing Form Layout

You can customize the Form Layout component used by Auto Form, with the `formLayoutProps` property. For example, you can set the `responsiveSteps` property to customize the responsive breakpoints of the Form Layout component:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-responsive-steps.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--


== Using Custom Renderer

To render a form in a completely different layout, you can use a custom renderer to define any arbitrary layout using the `layoutRenderer` property. Define a function that takes the `AutoFormLayoutRendererProps` as a parameter, that returns any React element. The parameter will contain the following properties:

- `children`, the read-only list of bound fields; and
- `form`, the form binder instance.

Since the children property is a read-only list of bound fields, you can use them in your custom renderer. The following example shows how to use the `children` property to render the fields in separate sub-form sections using the Vertical and Horizontal layouts:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-custom-renderer-alt.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

Alternatively, you can manually create input fields, and use the `form` instance to connect them to the form.

The following example shows how to render fields, manually:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-custom-renderer.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--


== Managing Form State

Auto Form component allows you to manage the form state in different scenarios. For instance, you can edit an item -- versus creating a new one -- by handling after submission events, and so on.

The following properties are available for managing the form state or reacting to form events:

- `item` is the item to be edited. If the item is `null`, the form is in _new_ mode, otherwise it is in _edit_ mode;
- `disabled` disables the whole form; and
- `onSubmitSuccess` is a callback function that's called after the form is submitted successfully.

The following example shows how to use the `item` property to manage switching between _new_ and _edit_ modes, and `onSubmitSuccess` for informing the user about the form submission success. Additionally, it uses `disabled` property to toggle the form's disabled state:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-edit-new-modes.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

Auto Form component supports Deletion functionality, which is associated with calling the `delete` method from the `CrudService` introduced to the Auto Form. The following properties are associated with managing this functionality:

- `deleteButtonVisible` is to stipulate whether to show the delete button in the form, which is hidden by default. If enabled, the delete button is only shown when editing an existing item: that means that `item` property is not null.
- `onDeleteSuccess` is a callback function that's called after the item is deleted successfully.

The following example shows how to use the `deleteButtonVisible` property to show the [guibutton]*Delete* button, and uses the `onDeleteSuccess` property to inform the user about the deletion success. You can toggle between the _edit_ and _new_ modes to see its effect on the visibility of the [guibutton]*Delete* button in action:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-delete-after-delete.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

The following properties are associated with managing the form actions error handling:

- `onSubmitError` is a callback that's called if an unexpected error occurs while submitting the form. The callback receives the error as a parameter.
- `onDeleteError` is a callback that's called if an unexpected error occurs while deleting the item. The callback receives the error as a parameter.

The next example shows how to use the `onSubmitError` and `onDeleteError` callbacks to inform the user about their respective errors:

[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-on-errors.tsx[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

.On Submit Error Not Called
[NOTE]
Note that `onSubmitError` callback is not be called for form validation errors, which are handled automatically.


== Validation

Auto Form uses the same validation mechanism as <</hilla/guides/forms/binder-validation#,default Hilla Forms>>. You can add Bean validation annotations to your entity classes, and the form automatically validates the input values on both client and server.

In the following example, annotations are added to the `Employee` class to ensure that `firstName` is neither `null` nor an empty string:

.Using Bean Validation Annotations
[source,java]
----
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotBlank;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull;

public class Employee {
    @NotNull
    @NotBlank
    private String firstName;

    // ...
}
----

For further information on using validation, refer to the <</hilla/guides/forms/binder-validation#,Forms>> documentation.

One notable difference to default forms is adding custom client-side validators. With Auto Form, custom client-side validators are added using the `validators` property in the `fieldOptions`. The following example shows how to add a custom validator to the `firstName` field:

.Using Custom Client-Side Validators in Auto Form
[source,tsx]
----
<AutoForm
  service={EmployeeService}
  model={EmployeeModel}
  fieldOptions={{
    firstName: {
      validators: [
        {
          message: 'First name must be longer than 3 characters',
          validate: (value: string) => value.length > 3,
        },
      ],
    },
  }}
/>
----


== Working with Plain Java Classes

Auto Form supports working with plain, non-JPA Java classes. This can be useful, for example if you want to use the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern to decouple your domain from your presentation logic, or you want to avoid serializing your JPA entities to the client due to performance concerns.


=== Implementing a Custom Service

To use plain Java classes, you need to provide a custom implementation of the `FormService<T>` interface. The following methods need to be implemented:

- `T save(T value)`: Either creates a new item or updates an existing one, depending on whether the item has an ID or not. Returns the saved item.
- `void delete(ID id)`: Deletes the item with the given ID.

The following example shows a basic implementation of a custom `FormService` that wraps a JPA repository. The service only accepts DTO instances from the client and maps between the DTO instances and JPA entities internally.
