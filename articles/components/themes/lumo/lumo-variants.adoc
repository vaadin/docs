= Lumo Variants

The Lumo theme comes with two color schemes: _light_, which is the default; and _dark_. It also includes a _compact_ preset that can be applied simultaneously with the color variants. These are essentially predefined customizations of Lumo's <<lumo-style-properties#, style properties>>.


== Light & Dark Color Schemes

In the screenshot here, you can see the difference between the default light color variant on the left, and the dark variant on the right -- which are both built into Lumo.

See <<{articles}/styling/themes#color-schemes,Color Schemes>> for how to apply different color schemes in your application.


== Compact Preset

Lumo also has a compact preset that reduces fonts sizes -- and proportionally all Vaadin components. It's applied by loading an additional stylesheet containing a modified set of Lumo sizing properties:
