The look and feel of all Vaadin components can be easily customized in a consistent manner across the entire application by supplying your own values to these style properties.

The built-in dark and compact variants are predefined sets of style property values that can be applied to the entire application or to parts of it.

The Lumo theme also includes a comprehensive set of CSS utility classes that can be applied to HTML elements and layout components through Java, to change their styling without writing any CSS of your own.
