= Binding Data to Grid [badge-flow]#Flow#
:toclevels: 2

Grid supports connecting to various types of data sources through data providers. A data provider is a class that implements the [interfacename]`DataProvider` interface and encapsulates the logic for fetching and counting items from a specific data source. Grid provides convenience methods to simplify common use cases where a full data provider setup isn't necessary, and also allows you to supply a custom data provider implementation for more complex scenarios.

== Binding Items with `setItems`

The `setItems` method in Grid is a convenience API that allows you to bind and display data from in-memory collections and simple lazy-loaded data sources without creating a data provider explicitly. This method offers several overloads for different scenarios and returns either a `GridListDataView` or `GridLazyDataView` instance, which let you configure the displayed items by applying filtering, sorting, and other options.

.Example: Binding a collection of items
[source,java]
----
GridListDataView dataView = grid.setItems(
    new Person("George Washington", 1732),
    new Person("John Adams", 1735),
    new Person("Thomas Jefferson", 1743),
    new Person("James Madison", 1751)
);
----

.Example: Binding items from a data service with lazy loading
[source,java]
----
GridLazyDataView dataView = grid.setItems(
    // Callback for fetching items, returns a Stream<Person>
    query -> personService.fetch(query.getOffset(), query.getLimit()),
    // Callback for counting items, returns an Integer
    query -> personService.count()
);
----

.Example: Filtering and sorting the resulting data view
[source,java]
----
dataView
    .addFilter(person -> person.getAge() >= 18)
    .setSortOrder(Comparator.comparing(Person::getName));
----

== Custom Data Providers

Alternatively, you can provide a custom data provider via the `setDataProvider` method, for example by passing your own class that implements the `DataProvider` interface.
