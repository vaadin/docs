= Components

The <<{articles}/ds/overview#, Vaadin Design System>> includes a set of components that you can use to build your UI.
The components have a server-side Java API in addition to the TypeScript API for client-side development.

xref:{articles}/ds/components#[Browse components, role="button primary water"]

You use a component by first creating it and then adding it to a containing layout.

For example, to add a <<{articles}/ds/components/button#, Button component>>, create the object and add it to a layout.
