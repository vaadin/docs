[[charts.installing]]
= Installing Charts for Vaadin Flow

As with most components for Vaadin Flow, you can install Charts for Flow as a Maven dependency in your project. Using Charts requires a license key, which is prompted for at development time after 24 hours from the first time the application with Vaadin Charts is opened.


[[charts.installing.maven]]
== Maven Dependency

Install Charts by adding the dependency to the project (here as a Maven dependency in [filename]`pom.xml`):

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-charts-flow</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

You don't need to specify the version number, as long as you have `vaadin-bom` imported.

Otherwise, add:

[source,xml]
----
<version>6.0.0</version>
----

Amend the version number to the one you require.

You also need to define the Vaadin add-ons repository, if this isn't already defined:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
   <id>vaadin-addons</id>
   <url>https://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-addons</url>
</repository>
----


[[charts.installing.license]]
== Installing a License Key

You need to have a valid license to develop your application with Charts.
After a period of 24 hours from when you open the application with Charts in a local browser, you see a pop-up that asks you to validate your subscription.
This pop-up opens a new tab that requires you to log in using your Vaadin account.
If the license is valid, it's saved to the local storage of the browser, after which you don't see the pop-up again.
