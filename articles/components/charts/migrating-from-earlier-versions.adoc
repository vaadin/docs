= Migrating from Earlier Versions

Charts 9 comes with new chart types and brings back the Java styling API. This page provides information on migrating chart components from earlier versions.

== Summary of Changes

* Upgraded to Highcharts 8.1
* You can style with either the Java API (default) or CSS
* New chart types:
** <<charttypes#charts.charttypes.bullet,Bullet Chart>>
** <<charttypes#charts.charttypes.organization,Organization Chart>>
** <<charttypes#charts.charttypes.timeline,Timeline Chart>>
** <<charttypes#charts.charttypes.xrange,X-Range Chart>>
* New Java API for lazy drill-down

== Migration Guide

If you are migrating your project from an earlier Vaadin version, the steps vary depending on the version number and the styling option you choose.

.You cannot use both CSS and Java styling in the same project
[CAUTION]
Only one styling method should be used across all charts. While there is no error thrown when different styling methods are used in the same project, using both may lead to unexpected results.

=== Migrating from Vaadin 8

==== Using Java API Styling

No action is required since Charts uses the Java API for styling by default.

.Small Changes
NOTE: There might be some small changes to the APIs compared to the Highcharts version used in Vaadin 8.

==== Using CSS Styling

If you want to convert your project to use CSS styling instead of Java, you can enable it by setting `styledMode` to `true`:

[source,java]
----
Chart chart = new Chart();
Configuration conf = chart.getConfiguration();
conf.getChart().setStyledMode(true);
----

See the <<css-styling#,CSS Styling guide>> for detailed instructions.

=== Migrating from Vaadin 10

==== Using Java API Styling

No action is required if your project doesn't have custom Charts themes.

If it has custom themes, you need to remove them and their `@CssImport` annotations before using the Java API for styling.


==== Using CSS Styling

To keep using CSS styling, you can enable it by setting `styledMode` to `true`:

[source,java]
----
Chart chart = new Chart();
Configuration conf = chart.getConfiguration();
conf.getChart().setStyledMode(true);
----

See the <<css-styling#,CSS Styling guide>> for detailed instructions.

=== Running Charts 9 in Vaadin 14

Although Charts 9 was released in a later Vaadin version, you can use it in a Vaadin 14 project in *npm mode* by overriding the version number in the [filename]`pom.xml` file:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-charts-flow</artifactId>
    <version>9.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

.Version Number
TIP: You can find the latest version on the https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-charts-flow/releases[Charts release page].


==== Using Java API Styling

No action is required if your project doesn't have custom Charts themes.

If it has custom themes, you need to remove them and their `@CssImport` annotations before using the Java API for styling.
