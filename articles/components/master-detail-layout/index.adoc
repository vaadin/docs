= Master-Detail Layout

// tag::description[]
Master-Detail Layout is component for building UIs with a horizontally or vertically split pair of a master (or primary) area and a detail (or secondary) area that can responsively switch to an overlay.

In the example below, clicking a row in the table reveals the detail area which is rendered next to the master area by default. Drag the splitter to change the width of the layout: the detail area will switch to an overlay when the master area's minimum width is reached. Drag the layout smaller yet, and the overlay snaps to fully cover the layout.

== Orientation

By default, the Master-Detail Layout is split horizontally. This can be changed to a vertical split.

== Responsiveness

The detail area can be rendered in three different ways:

* *Split*: Side-by-side with the master area (horizontally or vertically, depending on the orientation);
* *Overlay*: As an overlay partially covering the master area;
* *Stacked*: As a full-size overlay fully covering the master area.

[.example]
--
ifdef::flow[]
[source,Java]
----
<source-info group="Flow"></source-info>
layout.setMasterMinSize("600px");
layout.setDetailSize("300px");
layout.setStackThreshold("600px");
----
endif::[]
ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
<source-info group="React"></source-info>
<MasterDetailLayout
  masterMinSize="600px"
  detailSize="300px"
  stackThreshold="600px"
/>
----
endif::[]
--

=== Overlay Based on Available Space

For each area, either a _fixed_ size or a _minimum_ size can be specified. The area with a minimum size takes whatever space is available next to the fixed size area. If the available space is smaller than the minimum size, the detail area is rendered as an overlay.

The two most common configurations are:

* A flexible master area with a minimum size, next to a fixed-size detail area;
* A fixed-size master area, next to a flexible detail area with a minimum size.

If both areas are configured to be flexible, whichever reaches its minimum size first determines the overlay breakpoint.

If not explicitly set, the layout tries to determine an appropriate minimum size automatically based on the content.

=== Stack Threshold

The layout size at which the overlay renders in _stack_ mode (i.e. fully covers the master area) is determined by the stack threshold. Stack mode can be disabled entirely by setting the threshold to `0px`.

=== Forced Overlay Mode

The layout can be configured to _always_ render the detail area as an overlay, regardless of minimum sizes:

[.example]
--
ifdef::flow[]
[source,Java]
----
<source-info group="Flow"></source-info>
layout.setForceOverlay(true);
----
endif::[]
ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
<source-info group="React"></source-info>
<MasterDetailLayout forceOverlay />
----
endif::[]
--

=== Overlay Containment Modes

The overlay can be configured to render in two different ways, called _containment modes_:

* Layout: The overlay only covers the master area (default);
* Viewport: The overlay covers the entire viewport (i.e. page).

[.example]
--
ifdef::flow[]
[source,Java]
----
<source-info group="Flow"></source-info>
layout.setContainment(MasterDetailLayout.Containment.VIEWPORT);
----
endif::[]
ifdef::react[]
[source,tsx]
----
<source-info group="React"></source-info>
<MasterDetailLayout containment="viewport" />
----
endif::[]
--

== Router Integration

Master-Detail Layout can be used as a router layout (see <<{articles}/flow/routing/layout#, Flow>>/<<{articles}/hilla/guides/routing#adding-layout-routes, Hilla>>), so that nested views are automatically rendered in the details area of the component. This allows showing nested views without having to manage the contents of the details area manually when the route changes, while providing the same benefits such as responsive behavior that the component normally provides.

[.example]
--

The Flow `MasterDetailLayout` component implements the `RouterLayout` interface. When using a view class that extends from `MasterDetailLayout` as a layout for a nested view, that view is then automatically shown in the details area of the component.

The example below shows how to set up a master and a detail view. The master view is `ProductListView`, which would show a list of products, and the detail view is `ProductDetailView`, which shows information about a specific product. The `ProductListView` extends from `MasterDetailLayout`, so that it can be used as a route layout by the detail view. It also configures a `@Route` so that it can be navigated to by itself. Assuming there is a main layout for the application, for example one using `AppLayout`, it configures that as a parent layout. The `ProductDetailView` configures a `@Route`, using the `ProductListView` as the route layout.

With this setup, when navigating to `/products`, the layout would only show the product list. When navigating to a product detail, for example `/products/1`, it would then also show the product details next to, or on top of, the product list.

[source,java]
----
<source-info group="Flow"></source-info>
@ParentLayout(MainLayout.class)
@Route(value = "products", layout = MainLayout.class)
public class ProductListView extends MasterDetailLayout { ... }

@Route(value = "products/:productId", layout = ProductListView.class)
public class ProductDetailView extends VerticalLayout { ... }
----

The `MasterDetailLayout` React component can be integrated with Hilla's routing mechanism, so that any nested views automatically show up in the details area of the component.

The example below shows how to set up a master and a detail view. The master view is `ProductListView`, which would show a list of products, and the detail view is `ProductDetailView`, which shows information about a specific product. `ProductListView` is a layout component that renders a `MasterDetailLayout` component. The layout component retrieves the nested child view using `useOutlet` and renders it into the details area. Depending on whether a nested child view is present, `MasterDetailLayout` will automatically show or hide the details area. `ProductDetailView` is just a regular component, there is no specific configuration necessary to make it work.

With this setup, when navigating to `/products`, the layout would only show the product list. When navigating to a product detail, for example `/products/1`, it would then also show the product details next to, or on top of, the product list.

[source,tsx]
----
<source-info group="Hilla"></source-info>
// frontend/views/products/@layout.tsx
import { useOutlet } from 'react-router';

export default function ProductListView() {
  const childView = useOutlet();

  return (
    <MasterDetailLayout>
      <MasterDetailLayout.Master>
        <ProductList />
      </MasterDetailLayout.Master>
      <MasterDetailLayout.Detail>
        { childView }
      </MasterDetailLayout.Detail>
    </MasterDetailLayout>
  );
}

// frontend/views/products/{productId}/@index.tsx
export default function ProductDetailView() { ... }
