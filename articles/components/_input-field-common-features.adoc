BASIC INPUT FIELD FEATURES
////

// tag::label[]
[#label]
.Label
[%collapsible]
====
The label is used to identify the input field. It supports plain-text content, and its length is limited to the width of the field. <<helper#,Helpers>> and <<tooltip#,Tooltips>> can be used to provide additional information that doesn't fit into the label.

Visible labels are strongly recommended for all input fields. In cases where the built-in label cannot be used, an external element can be associated as the field's label through the <<aria#,aria-labelledby>> attribute. Fields without any visible label should be provided an invisible label for assistive technologies through the <<aria#,aria-label>> attribute.
====
// end::label[]

// tag::helper[]
[#helper]
.Helper
[%collapsible]
====
Helpers are used to provide additional information that the user may need to fill in the field, such as format requirements or explanations of the field's purpose, below the field.

A style variant is available for rendering the helper <<#helper-above-field,above the field>>.

In addition to plain-text, helpers can contain components and other HTML elements, but for 
complex and interactive content is likely to have accessibility issues.
====
// end::helper[]

// tag::placeholder[]
[#placeholder]
.Placeholder
[%collapsible]
====
The placeholder is a text that is displayed when the field is empty. Its primary purpose is to provide a short input hint, such as the expected format, in cases where a <<#helper,Helper>> cannot be used.

Placeholders should not be used as a replacement for a visible label – see <<#label,Label>> for alternatives for the built-in field label. Be aware that placeholders can be mistaken for a filled-in value.
====
// end::placeholder[]

// tag::tooltip[]
[#tooltip]
.Tooltip
[%collapsible]
====
Tooltips are small text pop-ups displayed on hover and on keyboard-focus, that can be used to provide additional information about a field, in cases where an always-visible <<helper#,Helper>> is not appropriate. Helpers are generally recommended in favor of tooltips, as they provide much better discoverability and mobile support. See the <<../tooltip#,Tooltip>> documentation for more information.
====
// end::tooltip[]

// tag::clear-button[]
[#clear-button]
.Clear Button
[%collapsible]
====
The optional clear button, displayed when the field is not empty, clears the field's current value. Clear buttons can be especially useful in search and filter fields, where user often needs to clear the value, but less so in regular forms.
====
// end::clear-button[]

// tag::prefix-and-suffix[]
[#prefix-and-suffix]
.Prefix & Suffix
[%collapsible]
====
Prefix and suffix elements, rendered at either end of the field, can be used to display currency symbols, units, icons, and similar visual cues to the field's purpose or format.

Note that prefix and suffix elements typically do not work well with assistive technologies like screen readers, so the information conveyed by them should also be conveyed through other means, such as in the <<#label,Label>>, a <<#helper,Helper>> or through <<#aria,ARIA attributes>> on the field itself.
====
// end::prefix-and-suffix[]


////
CONSTRAINT FEATURES
////

// tag::required[]
[#required]
.Required
[%collapsible]
====
Required fields are marked with an indicator next to the label, and become invalid if left empty after having been focused. An error message explaining that the field is required needs to be provided manually.

An instruction text at the top of the form explaining the required indicator is recommended. The indicator itself can be customized through the `--lumo-required-field-indicator` style property. 
====
// end::required[]

// tag::min-and-max-length[]
[#min-and-max-length]
.Min & Max Input Length
[%collapsible]
====
The minimum and maximum value length constraints dictate the smallest and largest number of characters a field accepts, by limiting text entry to the maximum length, and triggering a validation error if a value shorter than the minimum length is entered. They can be used to enforce specific formats, or to cap the value to the length supported by the underlying database schema.

In cases where the length requirements may not be clear to the user, it's recommended to provide this information, for example by using a helper.
====
// end::min-and-max-length[]

// tag::pattern[]
[#pattern]
.Pattern
[%collapsible]
====
The pattern is a regular expression used to validate the full value entered into the field. Any value that doesn't match the pattern invalidates the field.
====
// end::pattern[]

// tag::preventing-invalid-input[]
[#preventing-invalid-input]
.Preventing Entry of Invalid Characters
[%collapsible]
====
A separate single-character regular expression can be used to restrict the characters that can be entered into the field. Characters that don't match the expression are rejected.
====
// end::preventing-invalid-input[]


////
STYLE VARIANTS
Note: add component-specific live examples after each of these includes!
////

//tag::text-alignment[]
[#text-alignment]
.Text Alignment
[%collapsible]
====
Three different text alignments are supported: left (default), center, and right.

Right-alignment is recommended for numerical values when presented in vertical groups, as it aids interpretation and comparison of values.
====
//end::text-alignment[]

//tag::small-variant[]
[#small-variant]
.Small Variant
[%collapsible]
====
The small variant can be used to make individual fields more compact. Note that the default size of fields can be customized through <<{articles}/styling/lumo/lumo-style-properties#,style properties>>.
====
//end::small-variant[]

//tag::helper-above-field[]
[#helper-above-field]
.Helper Above Field
[%collapsible]
====
The helper can be rendered above the field, below the label.
====
//end::helper-above-field[]

//tag::borders[]
[#borders]
.[since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.1]#Borders#
[%collapsible]
====
Borders can be added by providing a value, such as 1px, to the `--vaadin-input-field-border-width` style property. This can be applied globally to all input fields or to individual component instances. Borders are required to achieve <<https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-contrast, WCAG 2.1 level AA>> conformant color contrast with the default Lumo styling of fields.
