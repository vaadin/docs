BASIC INPUT FIELD FEATURES
////

// tag::basic-intro[]
[.collapsible-list]
== Basic Features

The following features, common to most input field components, are supported:
// end::basic-intro[]


// tag::label[]
[#label]
.Label
[%collapsible]
====
The label is used to identify the input field. It supports plain-text content, and its length is limited to the width of the field. <<#helper,Helpers>> and <<#tooltip,Tooltips>> can be used to provide additional information that doesn't fit into the label.

Visible labels are strongly recommended for all input fields. In cases where the built-in label cannot be used, an external element can be associated as the field's label through the `aria-labelledby` attribute. Fields without any visible label should include an invisible label for assistive technologies with the `aria-label` attribute.
====
// end::label[]


// tag::helper[]
[#helper]
.Helper
[%collapsible]
====
Helpers are used to provide additional information that the user may need to enter in the field, such as format requirements or explanations of the field's purpose below the field.

A style variant is available for rendering the helper <<#helper-above-field,above the field>>.

In addition to plain text, helpers can contain components and HTML elements. However, complex and interactive content is likely to have accessibility issues.
====
// end::helper[]


// tag::placeholder[]
[#placeholder]
.Placeholder
[%collapsible]
====
The placeholder is text that's displayed when the field is empty. Its primary purpose is to provide a short input hint (e.g., the expected format) in situations where a <<#helper,Helper>> cannot be used.

Placeholders should not be used as a replacement for a visible label. They can be mistaken for a manually entered value. See <<#label,Label>> for alternatives to the built-in field label.
====
// end::placeholder[]


// tag::tooltip[]
[#tooltip]
.Tooltip
[%collapsible]
====
Tooltips are small text pop-ups displayed on hover, and on keyboard-focus. They can be used to provide additional information about a field. This can be useful in situations where an always visible <<#helper,Helper>> is not appropriate. Helpers are generally recommended in favor of tooltips, though, as they provide much better discoverability and mobile support. See the <<../tooltip#,Tooltip>> documentation for more information.
====
// end::tooltip[]


// tag::clear-button[]
[#clear-button]
.Clear Button
[%collapsible]
====
The clear button -- which is displayed when the field is not empty -- clears the field's current value. Although the button itself is not keyboard focusable, the clear action can be taken with the kbd:[Esc] key, when the field has focus. The clear button can be especially useful in search and filter fields, where users often need to clear the value. They're less useful, however, in regular forms.
====
// end::clear-button[]


// tag::prefix-and-suffix[]
[#prefix-and-suffix]
.Prefix & Suffix
[%collapsible]
====
Prefix and suffix elements -- rendered at either end of the field -- can be used to display units, icons, and similar visual cues to the field's purpose or format.

Prefix and suffix elements typically don't work well with assistive technologies like screen readers. Therefore, the information communicated by them should also be conveyed through other means, such as in a <<#label,Label>>, a <<#helper,Helper>>, or through ARIA attributes on the field itself.
====
// end::prefix-and-suffix[]


// tag::prefix[]
[#prefix]
.Prefix
[%collapsible]
====
A prefix element -- rendered at the start of the field -- can be used to display units, icons, and similar visual cues to the field's purpose or format.

Prefix elements typically don't work well with assistive technologies like screen readers. Therefore, the information communicated by them should also be conveyed through other means, such as in a <<#label,Label>>, a <<#helper,Helper>> or through ARIA attributes on the field itself.
====
// end::prefix[]


// tag::suffix[]
[#suffix]
.Suffix
[%collapsible]
====
A suffix element -- rendered at the end of the field -- can be used to display units, icons, and similar visual cues to the field's purpose or format.

Suffix elements typically don't work well with assistive technologies like screen readers. Therefore, the information communicated by them should also be conveyed through other means, such as in a <<#label,Label>>, a <<#helper,Helper>>, or through ARIA attributes on the field itself.
====
// end::suffix[]

// tag::aria-labels[]
[#aria-labels]
.[since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.1]#External & Invisible Labels (ARIA)#
[%collapsible]
====
Visible labels are strongly recommended for all input fields. In situations where the built-in label cannot be used, an external element can be associated as the field's label through its element `id`. Fields without any visible label should be provided an invisible label for assistive technologies like screen readers.

////
READONLY AND DISABLED FIELDS
////

// tag::readonly-and-disabled[]
== Read-Only & Disabled

Fields used to display values should be set to `read-only` mode to prevent editing. Read-only fields are focusable and visible to screen readers. They can display tooltips. Their values can be selected and copied.

Fields that are currently unavailable should be `disabled`. The reduced contrast of disabled fields makes them inappropriate for displaying information. They can't be focused or display tooltips. They're invisible to screen readers, and their values cannot be selected and copied.

Disabled fields can be useful in situations where they can become enabled based on some user action. Consider hiding fields entirely if there's nothing the user can do to make them editable.
// end::readonly-and-disabled[]



////
VALIDATION FEATURES
////

// tag::bad-input[]
[#bad-input]
.Bad Input
[%collapsible]
====
Bad input refers to any input that cannot be parsed into a value of the field type. When an unparsable value is entered, the field resets the value to empty and becomes invalid. This constraint is non-configurable and enabled by default.
====
// end::bad-input[]

// tag::required[]
[#required]
.Required
[%collapsible]
====
Required fields are marked with an indicator next to the label, and become invalid if their value is first entered and then cleared.

An instruction text at the top of the form explaining the required indicator is recommended. The indicator itself can be customized with the `--lumo-required-field-indicator` style property.
====
// end::required[]


// tag::min-and-max-length[]
[#min-and-max-length]
.Min & Max Length
[%collapsible]
====
The minimum and maximum input length value constraints dictate the smallest, and the largest number of characters a field accepts. It triggers a validation error if a value shorter than the minimum length is entered, and limits text entered to the maximum length. They can be used to enforce specific formats, or to cap the value to the length supported by the underlying database schema.

In cases where the length requirements may not be clear to the user, it's recommended to provide this information, for example by using a Helper.
====
// end::min-and-max-length[]


// tag::pattern[]
[#pattern]
.Pattern
[%collapsible]
====
The pattern is a regular expression used to validate the full value entered into the field. Any value that doesn't match the pattern, invalidates the field.
====
// end::pattern[]


// tag::allowed-chars[]
[#allowed-chars]
.Allowed Characters
[%collapsible]
====
A separate single-character, regular expression can be used to restrict the characters that can be entered into the field. Characters that don't match the expression are rejected. However, values set programmatically are not subject to this restriction, even if they contain disallowed characters.
====
// end::allowed-chars[]

// tag::binder[]
.Data Binding & Custom Validation
[NOTE]
Flow and Hilla offer an advanced API called Binder that allows you to bind data and add custom validation rules for multiple fields, creating forms. You can learn more about Binder from the corresponding <<{articles}/flow/binding-data/components-binder-validation#,Flow>> and <<{articles}/hilla/lit/guides/forms/binder-validation#,Hilla>> articles.
// end::binder[]


////
STYLE VARIANTS
Note: add component-specific live examples after each of these includes.
////


// tag::styles-intro[]
[.collapsible-list]
== Style Variants

The following style variants can be applied:
// end::styles-intro[]


//tag::text-alignment[]
[#text-alignment]
.Text Alignment
[%collapsible]
====
Three different text alignments are supported: `left`, which is the default; `center`; and `right`.

Right-alignment is recommended for numerical values when presented in vertical groups. This tends to aid interpretation and comparison of values.
====
//end::text-alignment[]


//tag::small-variant[]
[#small-variant]
.Small Variant
[%collapsible]
====
The small variant can be used to make individual fields more compact. The default size of fields can be customized with <<{articles}/styling/lumo/lumo-style-properties#,style properties>>.
====
//end::small-variant[]


//tag::helper-above-field[]
[#helper-above-field]
.Helper Above Field
[%collapsible]
====
The helper can be rendered above the field, and below the label.
====
//end::helper-above-field[]


//tag::borders[]
[#borders]
.[since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24.1]#Borders#
[%collapsible]
====
Borders can be applied to the field surface by providing a value (e.g., `1px`) to the `--vaadin-input-field-border-width` CSS property. This can be applied globally to all input fields using the `html` selector, or to individual component instances. Borders are required to achieve https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-contrast[WCAG 2.1 level AA] conformant color contrast with the default Lumo styling of fields.

You can override the default border color with the `--vaadin-input-field-border-color` property.
