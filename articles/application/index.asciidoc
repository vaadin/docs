= Creating an Application

Hilla is an application framework where you write client-side code with TypeScript.
Hilla views connect with server-side Java endpoints that can provide business data and logic, and can connect further with back-end services.

This chapter gives a more thorough and a more practical overview of Hilla application basics.
The various topics in this chapter are described in more detail throughout the further documentation.

== Hilla Application Architecture

The basic elements of an application built with Hilla are:

Application Shell::
The `index.html` file that is loaded first sets up application styles and loads the application scripts.
The main entry point is an `index.ts` script, where you set up routes to display the various views of the application, and do any other initialization needed by the application.

Views::
The user interface of an application consists of one or more views.
Views are built from Hilla web components by extending the LitElement component.
Each view can display different data or other functionalities.
Typically, you have at least a main view, and possibly a login view to enter that.
A main view typically contain child views that fit inside the layout of the main view.
Such child views could be "Products", "Personnel", or "Tasks".

A view in Hilla is a web component that extends LitElement.
As such, it is an HTML element.
The views are defined declaratively in a reactive manner, where changes in its state cause the view to be redrawn to reflect the new data.

Binding views to data::
  Views typically display some data or allow entering some.
