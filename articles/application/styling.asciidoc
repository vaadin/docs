= Styling Flow Applications

[.lead]
Vaadin uses https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[Cascading Style Sheets] (CSS) to separate the appearance of the user interface from its logic.
Themes, which are a feature of the Vaadin <<{articles}/components#, Design System>>, are the standard way to organize styles in a Vaadin application.

To style your application and components, you should be comfortable writing CSS.
The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS[CSS tutorials on MDN Web Docs] are a great way to learn the basics of CSS.

For further reading, see the <<{articles}/styling#, Styling>> chapter.
