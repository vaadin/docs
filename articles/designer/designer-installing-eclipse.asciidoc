== Installing Eclipse and Plug-Ins

You need to install the following to use Vaadin Designer:

. Eclipse as described in
<<dummy/../../framework/installing/installing-eclipse#installing.eclipse,"Installing Eclipse IDE">>

. Vaadin Designer from link:http://vaadin.com/eclipse[vaadin.com/eclipse]

Optionally you can also install Vaadin Plug-in for Eclipse as described in
<<dummy/../../framework/installing/installing-eclipse#installing.eclipse.plugin,"Installing Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse">>.

Vaadin Designer is compatible with Eclipse Mars and later, available from
link:http://www.eclipse.org/downloads[www.eclipse.org/downloads]. We recommend
choosing the newest version of __Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers__.

Vaadin Designer can be installed together with the Vaadin Plug-in for Eclipse, from
the same Eclipse update-site. In Eclipse, go to "Help > Install New Software",
press [guibutton]#Add...#, enter [literal]#++Vaadin++# as name and 
[uri]#http://vaadin.com/eclipse# as location.

If you already have the Vaadin plug-in installed, just choose the Vaadin update site.
Make sure the whole Vaadin category is selected (or at least
Vaadin Designer), then click [guibutton]#Next# to review licensing information
and finalize the install. Please restart Eclipse when prompted.

Once installed, Vaadin Designer can be kept up-to-date by periodically running
"Help > Check for Updates".

[[designer.installing.uninstalling]]
== Uninstalling

. Go to [guilabel]#About Eclipse#.
. Click [guibutton]#Installation Details#
. Select [guilabel]#Vaadin Designer# from the list.
