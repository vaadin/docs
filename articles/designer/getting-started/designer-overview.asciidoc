Vaadin Designer is a visual WYSIWYG tool for creating Vaadin UIs and views by
using drag&amp;drop and direct manipulation. With features such as live external
preview and a strong connection between the HTML and the
Java code, it allows you to design and layout your UIs with speed and
confidence.

Vaadin Designer works with Vaadin 10+ and Vaadin Framework 8
designs. Check the Framework 8 documentation for more information about
Framework designs and their declarative format.

Vaadin Designer is used to create a JavaScript file that defines a
UI, or part of a UI. The HTML JavaScript is called a __design__.

For a design, Vaadin Designer can create and update a Java file known as the
__companion file__. The companion file exposes elements of the
design to Java and provides a way to bind data between Java and the UI defined
in the design.

A design can be the whole UI or (more commonly) a smaller part of the UI, such
as a view or its sub-component. A UI or view can contain many designs.
