[#add-route-to-main-view]
== Adding the route to the main view

We previously replaced the original `MainView` with our own. The new one does not have an `@Route` annotation which we need set our view as the the root route.

. Switch back to IntelliJ IDEA.
. Expand the `src/main/java/com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui` package and open `MainView.java`.
. Add the `@Route("")` annotation at the beginning of the `MainView` class.

Your `MainView` class should now look like this:

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Tag("main-view")
@JsModule("./src/views/main-view.js")
@Route("") <1>
public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {
    // The rest of the file is omitted from the code snippet
}
----
<1> The `@Route` annotation maps http://localhost:8080/ to `MainView`.

[#layout-finished-run-the-project]
== Running the project

Next, we run the project to see how the new layout will look like.

The easiest way to run the project for the first time is to:

. Open the `Application` Java class in `src/main/java/com/vaadin/tutorial/crm/Application.java`
. Click the green play button next to the line which starts with "public class Application".

+
This starts the application and automatically adds a run configuration for it in IntelliJ IDEA. Later, when you want to run or restart the application, you can build, run/restart, stop and debug the application from the toolbar:

When the build is finished and the application is running. Open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to see the result.
