= What is Vaadin Designer?

Vaadin Designer is a commercial tool included in Vaadin Pro, Prime, and Enterprise subscriptions. We offer a free, 14-day trial for our commercial products and you do not need to provide any credit card information to get started.

In this tutorial, you learn how to build an application with Vaadin Designer, including how to create new views, create layout components, adjust CSS, and integrate views with the backend. This is a hands-on tutorial, so you can read the explanations and follow the steps to build the same application.
