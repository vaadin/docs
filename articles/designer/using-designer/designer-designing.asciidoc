= Designing

To add a component to your design, drag it from the
[guilabel]#Palette# view and drop it in the desired location - either in the viewport
area or in the hierarchical [guilabel]#Outline# view. Dropping in the desired
location on the viewport is a common approach, but in many situations
(especially with complex, deeply nested hierarchies) dropping on the
[guilabel]#Outline# view gives more control.

== Adding Components

Components can be added by dragging from the [guilabel]#Palette# view, either to the canvas or
to the [guilabel]#Outline# view. You can also double-click an component in the Palette
to add a sibling to the currently selected component.

The component you add will be selected in the editor view, and you can
immediately edit its properties.

[[designer.designing.properties]]
== Editing Properties

You can edit component properties in the [guilabel]#Properties# view. It is a
good idea to give components at least an `id`, if they are to be used
from Java code to add logic (such as click listeners for buttons). Generally,
this is needed for most controls, but not for most layouts.

Vaadin Designer will discover the defined properties of the selected web component.
Public properties (name does not start with an underscore '$$_$$') and non-readonly properties will be populated to the properties table.
You can also add a new property by clicking the plus button ([guibutton]#+#) on the [guilabel]#Attributes# panel header.

TIP: Some boolean properties might not have a checkbox in the Properties view editor.
Vaadin Designer cannot guess the type of the properties without a predefined default value.
A workaround for this issue is to add the boolean attribute into the declarative using in *Source mode*, then switch back to the *Edit mode*.
For example: `<vaadin-text-field *disabled*></vaadin-text-field>`

=== Text Panel
The Text Panel is shown for all components. You can add text to a component
by clicking the plus button ([guibutton]#+#) on the panel header.

When the selected component has exactly one text, you can edit the text directly in the Text panel.

.Edit text

If the component has multiple texts, the panel informs that they need to be edited individually.
You can click [guibutton]#Edit first text# button to start editing the first one.

=== Theme Property
When editing a Vaadin element, [guilabel]#theme# property is always available in properties table,
and you can easily apply styles from https://vaadin.com/themes[Vaadin Themes].
For example, to change the visual appearance of a Vaadin Button you can apply the `primary` style.
