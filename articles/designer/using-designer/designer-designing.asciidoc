= Designing

To add a component to your design, drag it from the
[guilabel]#Palette# view and drop it in the desired location - either in the viewport
area or in the hierarchical [guilabel]#Outline# view. Dropping in the desired
location on the viewport is a common approach, but in many situations
(especially with complex, deeply nested hierarchies) dropping on the
[guilabel]#Outline# view gives more control.

[[designer.designing.adding]]
== Adding Components

Components can be added by dragging from the [guilabel]#Palette# view, either to the canvas or
to the [guilabel]#Outline# view. You can also double-click an component in the Palette
to add a sibling to the currently selected component.

The component you add will be selected in the editor view, and you can
immediately edit its properties.

[[designer.designing.properties]]
== Editing Properties

You can edit component properties in the [guilabel]#Properties# view. It is a
good idea to give components at least an `id`, if they are to be used
from Java code to add logic (such as click listeners for buttons). Generally,
this is needed for most controls, but not for most layouts.

Vaadin Designer will discover the defined properties of the selected web component.
Public properties (name does not start with an underscore '$$_$$') and non-readonly properties will be populated to the properties table.
You can also add a new property by clicking the plus button ([guibutton]#+#) on the [guilabel]#Attributes# panel header.

TIP: Some boolean properties might not have a checkbox in the Properties view editor.
Vaadin Designer cannot guess the type of the properties without a predefined default value.
A workaround for this issue is to add the boolean attribute into the declarative using in *Source mode*, then switch back to the *Edit mode*.
For example: `<vaadin-text-field *disabled*></vaadin-text-field>`

=== Text Panel
The Text Panel is shown for all components. You can add text to a component
by clicking the plus button ([guibutton]#+#) on the panel header.

When the selected component has exactly one text, you can edit the text directly in the Text panel.

.Edit text

If the component has multiple texts, the panel informs that they need to be edited individually.
You can click [guibutton]#Edit first text# button to start editing the first one.

=== Theme Property
When editing a Vaadin element, [guilabel]#theme# property is always available in properties table,
and you can easily apply styles from https://vaadin.com/themes[Vaadin Themes].
For example, to change the visual appearance of a Vaadin Button you can apply the `primary` style.

[[designer.designing.previewing]]
== Previewing

While creating a design, it is convenient to preview how the UI will behave in
different sizes and on different devices. There are a number of features geared
for this.

[[designer.designing.previewing.resize]]
=== Resizing viewport and presets

By resizing the viewport, you can preview how your design will behave in different sizes, just as if it was
displayed in a browser window that is being resized.

You can manually resize the viewport by grabbing just outside of an edge or
corner of the viewport, and dragging to the desired size. When you resize the
viewport, you can see that the viewport control on the toolbar changes to
indicate the current size.

By typing in the viewport control, you can also input a specific size (such as
"[literal]#++200 x 200++#"), or open it up to reveal size presets. Choose a
preset, such as [guilabel]#Phone# to instantly preview the design on that size.

.Viewport Preset Sizes

You can also add your own presets - for instance known portlet or dashboard tile
sizes, or other specific sizes you want to target.

To preview the design in the other orientation (portrait vs. landscape), press
the icon right of the viewport size control.


[[designer.designing.previewing.quick]]
=== Preview

The [guilabel]#Preview# is one of the modes available to the right in
the toolbar (the other modes being [guilabel]#Edit# and [guilabel]#Source#). In
this mode, all designing tools and indicators are removed from the UI, and you
can interact with components - type text, open dropdowns, check boxes, tab
between fields, and so on. It allows you to quickly get a feel for (for
instance) how a form will work when filling it in.

[[designer.designing.previewing.external]]
=== External Preview

The external preview popup shows a QR code and its associated URL. By browsing
to the URL with browser or device that can access your computer (that is, on
the same LAN), you can instantly see the design and interact with it. This view
has no extra designer-specific controls or viewports added, instead it just
shows the design as-is; the browser is the viewport.

External preview allows multiple browsers and devices to be connected at once,
and they are all updated live as you change the design in the IDE. This is an
awesome way to instantly preview results on multiple devices and
browsers, or to show off a design and collaborate on it - for instance in a
meeting setting.
