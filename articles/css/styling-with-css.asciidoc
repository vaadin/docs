= Styling Views and Layouts With CSS

This section outlines how to add CSS styles to views and components in Hilla applications. 

== CSS Theme folder

You can style components extending `View` and `Layout` by placing CSS files in the `frontend/themes/<app-name>/` folder and importing them in `styles.css` using `import()`.
Styles defined in the theme directory are availabe across the application. 
You can also import styles from `node_modules`, like `line-awesome` in the example below:

.`frontend/themes/<app-name>/styles.css`
[source,css]
----
@import url('line-awesome/dist/line-awesome/css/line-awesome.min.css');

@import url('./main-layout.css');
@import url('./views/example-view.css');

== Using CSS Variables

Hilla uses the https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/foundation[Vaadin Design System^] as a base for component and application themes.
The design system defines CSS variables that can be used to achieve a consistent look and feel across the application. 
The variables are documented in the design system documentation: 

- https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/foundation/typography[Typography^]
- https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/foundation/color[Color^]
- https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/foundation/size-space[Size and Space^]
- https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/foundation/shape[Shape^]
- https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/foundation/elevation[Elevation^]
- https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/foundation/interaction[Interaction^]
- https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/foundation/icons[Icons^]

You can use the variables in place of hard-coded units using `var()`;
