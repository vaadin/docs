= Deploying Using Servlet Container

Deploying a Vaadin application to traditional servlet containers, such as Tomcat, Jetty or any Java/Jakarta EE server, is not very different from other web applications.
You just need to ensure that the production profile is used in your build to achieve optimal performance.

Follow the official documentation of your Servlet container for the best practices in production deployment.

You may want to follow examples that you find that use your favorite Servlet container.
