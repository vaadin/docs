= Deploying a Vaadin Application to Google Cloud

This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Vaadin application to Google Cloud App Engine.
Google Cloud has free-trial and free-tier offerings that you can read more about on the link:https://cloud.google.com/free/[Google Cloud website].

.Google Cloud account required
[NOTE]
To complete this tutorial, you need to sign up for a Google Cloud account at https://cloud.google.com/.
Your Google Cloud account should also have the billing enabled.

== Step 1: Install and Set Up Google Cloud SDK

To begin, download and install the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[Google Cloud SDK].

After it is installed, run the following command from a terminal window to add App Engine support for Java to the SDK.

[source,terminal]
----
gcloud components install app-engine-java
----

== Step 2: Download a Starter App

Download a minimal Vaadin project and unpack the downloaded zip into a folder on your computer.

== Step 3: Initialize a Google Cloud Project

Open the project directory from a terminal window, and enter the following command to initialize a Google Cloud Project:

[source,terminal]
----
gcloud init
----

If this is your first time running Google SDK, you will be asked to authenticate your account.
When prompted to log in, enter *'Y'* and allow the SDK to control your account in the opened browser window.

After authentication, you will prompted to select a configuration.
Enter '1' to select the default configuration, as in the following snippet:

[source]
----
Settings from your current configuration [default] are:
accessibility:
  screen_reader: 'False'
core:
  account: john.doe@gmail.com
  disable_usage_reporting: 'True'

Pick configuration to use:
 [1] Re-initialize this configuration [default] with new settings
 [2] Create a new configuration
Please enter your numeric choice:  1
----

== Step 4: Create an App Engine Instance

From a terminal window, in the project root directory, create a Google App Engine instance using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
gcloud app create
----

You will then be asked to select a region.
You may want to choose the region that is geographically closest to your users.

== Step 5: Create a Production Build

Open the project directory from a terminal window, and enter the following command to generate a `JAR` file of your application:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn package -Pproduction
----

== Step 6: Deploy the Application

From a terminal window, in the project root directory, enter the following command to deploy the application to Google Cloud:

[source,terminal]
----
gcloud app deploy target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

When the deployment has finished, the application URL will be displayed in the logs.

.Ensure that Google Cloud billing is enabled
[NOTE]
If the deployment fails with an error similar to `ERROR: (gcloud.app.deploy) Error Response: [7] Access Not Configured.`, then ensure that your Google Cloud account has billing enabled.
When it is enabled, try the deployment again.
