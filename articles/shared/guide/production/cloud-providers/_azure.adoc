== Step 3: Add the Azure Plugin

Open your [filename]#pom.xml# file and add the following section in the `<plugins>` tag in the `<build>` section:

.`pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-webapp-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.2.3</version>
</plugin>
----

== Step 4: Create a Production Build

Open the project directory from a terminal window, and enter the following command to generate a `JAR` file of your application:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn package -Pproduction
----

== Step 5: Configure Your Application

From the terminal window, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn azure-webapp:config
----

This command authenticates you with Azure via the browser, assuming you are not already logged in with Azure CLI.
Then you are prompted to choose from various options.
For example, you could select the following:

. *<create>* when asked to choose a Java SE Web App
. *Linux* when asked to choose an OS
. *Java* 11 for the Java version
. *F1* for the pricingTier
. Enter *'Y'* on your keyboard to confirm

== Step 6: Deploy Your Application

Enter the following command to deploy your application:

[source,terminal]
----
mvn azure-webapp:deploy
----

You may be required to authenticate again in the browser.
Once authenticated, your application is deployed to Azure and you should see your application URL in the logs, as in the following screenshot.
