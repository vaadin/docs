[source,terminal]
----
mvn package -Pproduction
----

== Step 5: Configure your Application

From the terminal window, enter `mvn azure-webapp:config` command. This command will first authenticate you with Azure via the browser (assuming you are not already logged in with Azure CLI). After that you will be asked to make a number of selections. You can select:

. *<create>* when asked to choose a Java SE Web App.
. *Linux* when asked to choose an OS.
. *Java* 11 for the Java version
. *F1* for the pricingTier
