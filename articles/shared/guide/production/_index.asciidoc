= Deploying to Production

[.lead]
Deploying to a production server involves compiling and packaging the application to be suitable and optimized for the server.

While you may have launched your server directly from your IDE during development, for production you need to deploy the application as a WAR file (Java Servlet) or JAR file that includes your application server (Spring Boot & other embedded servers).

By default, Vaadin applications are set up to run in the development mode.
This requires a bit more memory and CPU power, but enables easier debugging.
When deploying your app to your users, you will want to switch to the production mode instead.

The main difference between the development and production modes is that in the development mode Vaadin uses webpack to serve JavaScript files to the browser, instead of the Java server the app is running on.
This is so that if you change a JS or CSS file, your changes are picked up and served automatically.
When in production mode, you do not want this extra overhead since the files will not change; it is more efficient to prepare JavaScript and CSS files once, during build, and let one server (the Java Server) serve all requests.
At the same time, the client resources can be optimized and minified to reduce the load on the network and browser even further.

== Enabling the Production Mode

The `pom.xml` file in a Vaadin project has the following built-in Maven configuration for creating a production mode build:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>production</id>
        <properties>
            <vaadin.productionMode>true</vaadin.productionMode>
        </properties>

        <!--
		.. configuration depending on environment ..
		 -->
         <executions>
             <execution>
                 <goals>
                     <goal>build-frontend</goal>
                 </goals>
                 <phase>compile</phase>
             </execution>
         </executions>
		 <!--
		 .. more configuration ..
		 -->
    </profile>
</profiles>
----

The actual content of the profile will depend on what environment your app is running in, but all of the variations do two things:

. Setting the property `vaadin.productionMode` to `true`
. Calling the Maven goal `vaadin:build-frontend`. The Maven goal `vaadin:prepare-frontend` is also required, but that is often declared already in the development build.

To create a production build, you can call `mvn clean package -Pproduction`.
This will build a JAR or WAR file with all the dependencies and transpiled front end resources, ready to be deployed.
The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

If you do not have the production Maven profile in your POM file, the easiest way to get it is to get a project base from https://vaadin.com/start matching your environment (Spring Boot, Jakarta EE, or plain Java), and copy the production profile from the downloaded POM file.

Having production mode be a separate Maven profile is recommended so that you do not get any unexpected problems due to production settings when running in the development mode.

.Building for 64-bit
[NOTE]
If your operating system is 64-bit, make sure to use a 64-bit JDK installation as well.

=== Excluding the Development Server Module

The webpack server integration and Live reload features, which are available only in development mode, are contained in the module `com.vaadin:vaadin-dev-server`.
When running the application in production mode, it is recommended to exclude this module.
This can be achieved by adding the following dependency exclusion to the `<dependencies>` section in the `production` profile:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>production</id>

        <!-- above production mode configuration -->

        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
                <artifactId>vaadin</artifactId>
                <exclusions>
                    <exclusion>
                        <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
                        <artifactId>vaadin-dev-server</artifactId>
                    </exclusion>
                </exclusions>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </profile>
</profiles>
----

This results in less code and dependency libraries being bundled in the production application.

== Transpilation and Bundling

Transpilation in Vaadin means converting all ES6 JavaScript to ES5 JavaScript format for older browsers.
All Vaadin components are written using ES6, and consist of several JavaScript and CSS files.
Transpilation makes sure this newer JavaScript code also works in browsers which do not support all the latest JavaScript features.

During the build, minimization is done to make the files smaller.
When minifying code, it is often obscured, which makes it harder to read, hence this is not done in the development mode.

Bundling is an optimization where we merge multiple files to a single collection so that the browser doesn't need to request so many files from the server.
This makes the application load faster.

== Plugin Goals and Goal Parameters

=== prepare-frontend

This goal validates whether the `node` and `npm` tools are installed and not too old (`node` version 10 or later and `npm` version 5.6 or later), and also installs them automatically to the `.vaadin` folder in the user's home directory if they are missing.
If they are installed globally but too old, there will be an error message suggesting to install newer versions instead.
Node.js is needed to run npm for installing frontend dependencies and webpack which bundles the frontend files served to client.

In addition, it visits all resources used by the application and copies them under `node_modules` folder so they are available when `webpack` builds the frontend. It also creates or updates `package.json`, `webpack.config.json` and `webpack.generated.json` files.

==== Goal Parameters

* *includes* (default: `&#42;&#42;/&#42;.js,&#42;&#42;/&#42;.css`):
    Comma separated wildcards for files and directories that should be copied. Default is only `.js` and `.css` files.

* *npmFolder* (default: `${project.basedir}`):
    The folder where `package.json` file is located. Default is project root folder.

* *webpackTemplate* (default: `webpack.config.js`):
    Copy the `webapp.config.js` from the specified URL if missing. Default is the template provided by this plugin.
    Set it to empty string to disable the feature.

* *webpackGeneratedTemplate* (default: `webpack.generated.js`):
    Copy the `webapp.config.js` from the specified URL if missing. Default is the template provided by this plugin.
    Set it to empty string to disable the feature.

* *generatedFolder* (default: `${project.build.directory}/frontend/`):
    The folder where Flow will put generated files that will be used by webpack.

* *require.home.node* (default: `false`):
   If set to `true`, always prefer Node.js automatically downloaded and installed into the `.vaadin` directory in the user's home.


=== build-frontend
This goal builds the frontend bundle.
This is a complex process involving several steps:

- update `package.json` with all `@NpmPackage` annotation values found in the classpath and automatically install these dependencies.
- update the JavaScript files containing code for importing everything used in the application. These files are generated in the `target/frontend` folder,
and will be used as entry point of the application.
- create `webpack.config.js` if not found, or updates it in case some project parameters have changed.
- generate JavaScript bundles, chunks and transpile to ES5 using `webpack` server. Target folder in case of `war` packaging is `target/${artifactId}-${version}/build` and in case of `jar` packaging is `target/classes/META-INF/resources/build`.

==== Goal Parameters

*npmFolder* (default: `${project.basedir}`::
    The folder where `package.json` file is located. Default is project root folder.

*generatedFolder* (default: `${project.build.directory}/frontend/`)::
    The folder where Flow will put generated files that will be used by webpack.

*frontendDirectory* (default: `${project.basedir}/frontend`)::
    A directory with project's frontend source files.

*generateBundle* (default: `true`)::
    Whether to generate a bundle from the project frontend sources or not.

*runNpmInstall* (default: `true`)::
    Whether to run `pnpm install` (or `npm install`, depending on *pnpmEnable* parameter value) after updating dependencies.

*generateEmbeddableWebComponents* (default: `true`)::
    Whether to generate embedded web components from WebComponentExporter inheritors.

*optimizeBundle* (default: `true`)::
    Whether to include only frontend resources used from application entry points (the default) or to include all resources found on the class path.
    Should normally be left to the default, but a value of `false` can be useful for faster production builds or debugging discrepancies between development and production mode.

*pnpmEnable* (default: `false`)::
    Whether to use the _pnpm_ or _npm_ tool to handle frontend resources. By default _npm_ is used.

*useGlobalPnpm* (default: `false`)::
    Whether to use a globally installed _pnpm_ tool instead of the default supported version of _pnpm_.

=== clean-frontend
This goal will `clean-frontend` files that may cause inconsistencies when changing versions.
It is suggested to not add the goal as a default to pom.xml and instead use it with `mvn vaadin:clean-frontend` when necessary.

Executing the clean-frontend goal will remove

- the package lock file
- the generated frontend folder (by default `frontend/generated`)
- `node_modules` folder (this might need manual deletion)

The goal will also clean all dependencies that are framework managed, and any dependencies that target the build folder from the `package.json` file.

The `clean-frontend` goal supports the same parameters as `prepare-frontend`.
