= Running an Application

[.lead]
Once you have imported an application in your IDE, you are ready to run it.
Applications created with <<{articles}/flow/guide/start#, Vaadin Start>> are Spring Boot applications, which you can run like ordinary Java applications.
Non-Spring Boot applications can be run with Maven.

With a Spring Boot application like the ones created with *Vaadin Start*, you simply need to run the [classname]#Application# class in the project.
That launches an embedded server to run the application.

See how to do that in your IDE: <<eclipse#, Eclipse>>, <<intellij#, IntelliJ>>, or <<netbeans#, NetBeans>>.

Many IDEs also support debugging Java applications.
Debugging goes like normally running an application, but you need to do it in debug mode in the IDE.

== Running With Maven

During development, you can run a Vaadin application in an embedded web server by executing one of the Maven goals:

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
| Technology Stack | Embedded Server | Goal to Run
| Spring Boot | – | `spring-boot:run`
| CDI / Java EE | Apache TomEE | `tomee:run`
| Plain Java | Jetty | `jetty:run`
|===

== Redeploying During Development

When you save a source file, the IDE automatically compiles it.
The web server tracks the compiled files and automatically redeploys the application when it notices a change.
You can then refresh the page to use the updated version.

You can also enable _live reload_ to have the page refreshed automatically, as described in <<{articles}/flow/guide/live-reload#, Live Reload>>.

== Debugging

Many IDEs also support debugging Java applications.
Debugging goes like normally running an application, but you need to do it in debug mode in the IDE.

.Debugging Spring Boot applications
[NOTE]
You can debug Spring Boot applications by running them as Java applications, but not with Maven with `spring-boot:run`.
The Maven goal starts the application in a separate process, so you can not debug it.
