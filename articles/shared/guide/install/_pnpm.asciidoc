pnpm reduces the download time across multiple projects by caching the downloaded packages.
It is the recommended and default package manager for Vaadin projects.

You do not need to install pnpm separately.

= Local and Global Installation

Vaadin uses npx, the node package runner to download and use a compatible version of pnpm.
It specifies the version using a version specifier, such as `pnpm@5.18.10`.

If you have installed pnpm globally (with `npm install -g pnpm`) and set up the configuration parameter `vaadin.pnpm.global=true`, the installed version is used unless it is determined to be too old.
Note that Vaadin requires pnpm 5 or newer.

= Install a Custom Package

To install a custom frontend package into your project with pnpm, install Node.js globally and run pnpm using npx.
For example, to add the `mobx` package as a dependency in `package.json` as well as install it into `node_modules`, run the following command in the project directory:

[source,terminal]
----
npx pnpm add mobx
----

If you have installed pnpm globally, you can alternatively call it directly:

[source,terminal]
----
pnpm add mobx
----

If you have already installed an older version of pnpm globally, the above command runs the old version.
In such case, either upgrade the globally installed pnpm or pass a version specifier to npx, for example, `pnpm@5.18.10`, instead of `pnpm`.
See the https://pnpm.js.org/[pnpm website] for more information about available commands and flags.

[NOTE]
Vaadin expects transitive platform dependencies to be available directly under `node_modules`.
In Vaadin versions earlier than 19 that use pnpm, the `--shamefully-hoist` flag must be explicitly given to pnpm during package installation: `pnpm i --shamefully-hoist mobx`.

= Custom Packages that need postinstall scripts

Starting from Vaadin 23, postinstall scripts for npm/pnpm packages are not run by default. This is to remove an attack vector where a new npm/pnpm package version with malware is published.

Some legitimate packages still use postinstall scripts and rely on them to work properly. For internal dependencies, Vaadin runs the postinstall scripts automatically. If you add custom packages that need postinstall scripts to be run, you can add the packages as a comma separated list to the `vaadin.npm.postinstallPackages` system property (for development mode) and using the `<postinstallPackages>` configuration property in Maven/Gradle for production mode.
