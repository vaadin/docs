= Install a Custom Package

To install a custom front-end package into your project with `npm`, run `npm i xxx`.
For example, to add the `mobx` package as a dependency in [filename]#package.json# as well as install it into `node_modules`, run the following command in the project directory:

[source,terminal]
----
npm i mobx
----

[NOTE]
Vaadin expects transitive platform dependencies to be available directly under `node_modules`.
Vaadin uses the `npm` https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides[overrides feature] (since `npm` 8.3.0) to lock the transitive platform dependencies versions.
