== Common Steps

These steps apply regardless of what version you are upgrading from.

. Delete the `node_modules` folder and either lock file: `package-lock.json` (with npm) or `pnpm-lock.yaml` (with pnpm).

. Edit the `pom.xml` file and change the Vaadin version to `{vaadin-version}`:
+
[source,xml]
----
include::{root}/pom.xml[tag=vaadin-version, indent=0]
----
+
.View full pom.xml
[TIP,role=small]
Click the "Expand code" button to view a complete reference `pom.xml` file.

. Update Spring Version (Spring-based projects only).
+
Vaadin is compatible with Spring 5.3.0 or newer, and Spring Boot 2.4.0 or newer.
If your application uses an older version of Spring, update it to a compatible version:
+
[source,xml]
----
include::{root}/pom.xml[tag=spring-version, indent=0]
----

. Run `mvn clean install`
