= Routing

The routing system in Hilla is built on top of https://reactrouter.com/en/main[React Router], a popular routing library for React applications. This documentation will guide you through the basics of setting up and using routing in your application.

Routes are managed through a configuration file called `routes.tsx`. This file defines the routes of your application, including the components associated with each route. The routing configuration is located in the `frontend` directory of your project.

Here's an example of how the configuration typically looks like in a starter application:

[source,tsx]
----
export const routes: RouteObject[] = [
  {
    element: <MainLayout />,
    children: [
      { path: '/', element: <HelloReactView /> },
      { path: '/about', element: <AboutView /> },
    ],
  },
];

export default createBrowserRouter(routes);
----

In this example, we have defined two routes: the root path `'/'` and the `/about` path. These routes are associated with different components, and the `<MainLayout />` component acts as the layout template for the entire application. The last line creates and exports the router instance.

The router instance is then used in the `App.tsx` file to render the application:

[source,tsx]
----
import router from 'Frontend/routes.js';
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

export default function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}
----

Next, let's dive into the details of how to work with routing in Hilla.

== Adding Routes

To add a new route to your application, follow these steps:

1. Create a new component that should be displayed when the route is active. For example, create a file called `MyRoute.tsx` in the `views` folder with the following contents:
+
[source,tsx]
----
export default function MyRouteView() {
  return <div>My first route</div>;
}
----
2. Open the `routes.tsx` file.
3. Import the component you created in the previous step:
+
[source,tsx]
----
import MyRouteView from 'Frontend/views/MyRoute';
----
4. Inside the `routes` array, add a new route object to the `children` array of the main layout:
+
[source,tsx]
----
{
  path: '/my-route',
  element: <MyRouteView />,
}
----

Now, after saving the file, you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:8080/my-route and see the new component rendered in the browser.

To add a navigation link that points to your new route, use the `<NavLink>` component from `react-router-dom`:

[source,tsx]
----
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

<NavLink to="/my-route">My Route</NavLink>
----

This will create a clickable link in your application that navigates to the specified route.


== Adding Routes with Parameters

Sometimes, you may need to create routes that accept dynamic parameters, such as product IDs or names. This can be easily achieved by defining a route path with parameters. For example, the following route takes a product ID as a parameter:

[source,tsx]
----
{
  path: '/products/:productId',
  element: <ProductDetailView />
}
----

In this example, `:productId` acts as a placeholder for the actual product ID. To link to this route with a specific `productId`, you can use the `to` prop of `NavLink` like this:

[source,tsx]
----
<NavLink to="/products/123">Show product details</NavLink>
----

To access the route parameter, you can use the `useParams` hook from `react-router-dom` in your component. The following example outlines a details view that fetches product data for the product ID in the route:

[source,tsx]
----
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

export default function ProductDetailView() {
  const { productId } = useParams();

  // Fetch product details for the given ID
  const { product, setProduct } = useState<Product>();

  useEffect(() => {
    ProductEndpoint.getProduct(productId).then(setProduct);
  }, [productId]);
}
----

== Adding Custom Metadata

You may want to add custom metadata to your routes, which could be information like page titles, icons, or any other data relevant to your application's structure and layout.

To add custom metadata to a route, you can use the `handle` property of the route object:
[source,tsx]
----
{ path: '/about', element: <AboutView />, handle: { title: 'About us' } },
----

In this example, we have added a page title to the `/about` route.

To access this metadata from within a component, you can use the `useMatches` hook from `react-router-dom`. In the following example, we'll use the page title to display it in the header to the main layout:
[source,tsx]
----
import { useMatches } from "react-router-dom";

export default function MainLayout() {
  const matches = useMatches();
  const currentHandle = matches[matches.length - 1]?.handle as any;
  const pageTitle = currentHandle?.title ?? 'My App';

  return (
    <AppLayout primarySection="drawer">
      <header slot="drawer">
        <h1 className="text-l m-0">{pageTitle}</h1>
        ...
      </header>
      ...
    </AppLayout>
  );
}
----

Now, when the `/about` route is active, the title 'About us' will be displayed in the header.

== Programmatic Navigation

In some cases, you may need to navigate between routes programmatically, for example, in response to user interactions or application logic. For this we can use the `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom`. It provides a function that allows you to navigate to a specific route when called. Additionally, it offers options to control the navigation behavior, such as pushing to the history stack or replacing the current entry.

For example, after saving a product, you might want to navigate back to the product list:

[source,tsx]
----
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function ProductDetailView() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleSave = async () => {
    await ProductEndpoint.save(product);
    navigate('/products');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      ...
      <button onClick={handleSave}>Save</button>
    </div>
  );
}
----

By default, this will push a new entry to the browser's navigation history. If you want to replace the current entry instead, you can pass `{ replace: true }` as the second argument:

[source,tsx]
----
navigate('/products', { replace: true });
----

== Adding an Error Page

Adding a custom error page to your application is essential for handling cases where no other route matches the requested URL. This allows you to provide helpful feedback to the user, for example by communicating the problem or providing links to other pages.

To add an error page, follow these steps:

1. Create a new component for your error page (e.g., `ErrorView.tsx`). This component will be displayed when no other route matches:
+
[source,tsx]
----
export default function ErrorView() {
  return <div>Page not found</div>;
}
----
2. In your `routes.tsx` file, add a wildcard route at the end of your `routes` array. This route will match any unknown routes and display the error page.
+
[source,tsx]
----
{ path: '*', element: <ErrorView /> }
----
3. Customize your `ErrorView` component to provide helpful information to the user.

Now, your application is equipped with an error page that will be shown when no other route matches the requested URL.
