description: Context Menu is a component that you can attach to any component to display a context menu.

= Context Menu

The menu appears by default on right-click, or it can appear on left-click. On a touch device, a long press opens the context menu. Below is a default example:

[source,tsx]
----
<ContextMenu items={items}>
  <Grid items={people} allRowsVisible>
    <GridColumn path="firstName" />
    <GridColumn path="lastName" />
    <GridColumn path="email" />
    <GridColumn header="Phone number" path="address.phone" />
  </Grid>
</ContextMenu>
----


== Dividers

You can use dividers to separate and group related content. Use dividers sparingly to avoid creating unnecessary visual clutter.


== Checkable Menu Items

Checkable Menu Items can be used to toggle a setting on and off.


== Hierarchical Menu

Context Menu, like Menu Bar, supports multi-level sub-menus. You can use a hierarchical menu to organize a large set of options and group related items.


== Custom Items

You can customize the items to include more than a single line of text.


== Disabled Menu Items

You can disable menu items to show that they are unavailable.


== Left-Click

You can use left-click to open Context Menu in situations where left-click has no other function. An example of such a situation would be a Grid without selection support.


== Best Practices

Context Menu is used to offer shortcuts to the user. You shouldn't use it as the only or primary means to complete a task. The primary way should be accessible elsewhere in the UI.


=== Context Menu vs. Menu Bar

You should use Context Menu when there is no dedicated button for opening an overlay menu, such as right-clicking a grid row. When there is a dedicated element or component, such as an <<../menu-bar#,overflow menu>>, use Menu Bar.


=== Icons

Use icons when applicable to help improve recognition. It's recommended to use commonly recognized icons to avoid confusion. Use icons consistently throughout a list of options.


=== Labelling

Suffix a menu item with ellipses (i.e., "&hellip;") when the associated action won't be executed, but instead reveals some UI. An example of this is when an item leads to a dialog, for completing the action.
