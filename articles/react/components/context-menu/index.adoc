== Dividers

You can use dividers to separate and group related content.
Use dividers sparingly to avoid creating unnecessary visual clutter.

== Checkable menu items

Checkable Menu Items can be used to toggle a setting on and off.

== Hierarchical menu

Context Menu, like Menu Bar, supports multi-level sub-menus.
You can use a hierarchical menu to organize a large set of options and group related items.

== Custom items

You can customize the items to include more than a single line of text.

== Disabled menu items

You can disable menu items to show that they are unavailable.

== Left-click

You can use left-click to open Context Menu in situations where left-click doesn't have any other function, for example a Grid without selection support.

== Best practices

Context Menu is used to provide shortcuts to the user.
You shouldn't use it as the only or primary means to complete a task.
The primary way should be accessible elsewhere in the UI.

=== Context menu vs menu bar

You should use Context Menu when there is no dedicated button for opening an overlay menu, such as right-clicking a grid row.
When there is a dedicated element/component, such as an <<../menu-bar#,overflow menu>>, use Menu Bar.

=== Icons

Use icons when applicable to help improve recognition.
It's recommended to use commonly recognized icons to avoid confusion.
Use icons consistently throughout a list of options.

=== Labelling

Suffix a menu item with “...” when the associated action won't be executed, but instead reveal some UI, like a dialog, for completing the action.
