description: List Box allows the user to select one or more values from a scrollable list of items.

= List Box

Although its functionally is similar to <<../checkbox#,Checkbox Group>> and <<../radio-button#,Radio Button Group>>, List Box is designed to be used as a lightweight scrollable selection list, rather than as a form input field.


[source,tsx]
----
<ListBox multiple selectedValues={[0, 2]}>
  <Item>Show assignee</Item>
  <Item>Show due date</Item>
  <Item>Show statux</Item>
</ListBox>
----


== Dividers

You can use dividers to group related items. Use them sparingly, though, to avoid creating unnecessary visual clutter.


== Disabled Items

Disable items to show that they're unavailable for selection.

[NOTE]
====
Be aware that some assistive technologies don't announce disabled items.

== Selection

List Box supports both single and multiple selections. Single-selection allows the user to select only one item, whereas multiple-selection enables more than one item to be selected.


== Custom Item Presentation

Items can be rendered with rich content instead of plain text. This can be useful to give more information in a more legible fashion than appending the item text.

[source,tsx]
----
<ListBox multiple selectedValues={[0, 2]}>
  {persons.map((person) => (
    <Item
      key={person.id}
      style={{ lineHeight: "var(--lumo-line-height-m)" }}
    >
      <HorizontalLayout style={{ alignItems: "center" }} theme="spacing">
        <Avatar
          img={person.pictureUrl}
          name={`${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`}
        />
        <VerticalLayout>
          <span>{`${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`}</span>
          <span
            style={{
              color: "var(--lumo-secondary-text-color)",
              fontSize: "var(--lumo-font-size-s)",
            }}
          >
            {person.profession}
          </span>
        </VerticalLayout>
      </HorizontalLayout>
    </Item>
  ))}
</ListBox>

== Best Practices

List Box isn't designed to be used as an input field in forms, and lacks features such as label, helper, and validation errors. See related components for better options for use in forms. List Box is best suited for use as a lightweight, scrollable, single-column list for single or multi-selection of items.
