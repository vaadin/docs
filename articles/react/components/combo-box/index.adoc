= Combo Box

Combo Box supports lazy loading and can be configured to accept custom typed values. An example of a Combo Box where users can choose a country from a list is shown in the code here:
 
[source,tsx]
----
const countries = [
  { id: 1, name: "Finland" },
  { id: 2, name: "Germany" },
  { id: 3, name: "United States" },
];

return (
  <ComboBox
    label="Country"
    itemLabelPath="name"
    itemValuePath="id"
    items={countries}
  />
);
----

// TODO: define {article} and fix relative link
:component-name: ComboBox
:text-field-features: true
include::../_shared.asciidoc[tag=field-features]


== Custom Value Entry

Combo Box can be configured to allow entering custom values that aren't included in the list of options. This is done with the addition of `allowCustomValue` inside the `<ComboBox />` element, as shown in the example here:

[source,tsx]
----
<ComboBox
  allowCustomValue
  label="Country"
  itemLabelPath="name"
  itemValuePath="id"
  items={countries}
/>
----

Allowing custom entry is useful when you want to present the most common choices, but still give users the ability to enter their own values.


== Usage as Autocomplete Field

As the user is typing in a Combo Box, it filters out options that don't match. Once the user sees the correct value, they can use the kbd:[Up/Down] arrow keys to navigate the list, followed by the kbd:[Enter] key to set the value. Essentially, by this method, they're using the Combo Box as an autocomplete field of sorts.
