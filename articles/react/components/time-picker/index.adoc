= Time Picker

[source,tsx]
----
<TimePicker label="Alarm" value="07:00" />
----

The time can be entered directly using a keyboard or by choosing a value from a set of predefined options presented in an overlay. The overlay opens when the field is clicked, or when any input is entered while the field is focused.

== Step

Time Picker's step parameter defines the interval in seconds between the items displayed in the overlay. It also specifies the amount by which the time increases or decreases using the kbd:[Up] or kbd:[Down] arrow keys when the overlay is disabled.

The default step is one hour (i.e., `3600` seconds). Unlike <<../number-field#,Number Field>>, Time Picker accepts values that don't align with the specified step.

[source,tsx]
----
<TimePicker label="Meeting time" step={60 * 30} value="12:30" />

.Use Common Steps
[NOTE]
The step must evenly divide an hour or a day. For example, _"15 minutes"_ and _"30 minutes"_ are valid steps for an hour, and _"2 hours"_ is valid for a day, whereas _"42 minutes"_ isn't for either.

The displayed time format changes based on the step.

[source,tsx]
----
<TimePicker label="Meeting time" step={1} value="15:45:08" />
