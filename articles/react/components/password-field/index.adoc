= Password Field

The input is masked by default. On mobile devices, the last typed letter is shown for a brief moment. The masking can be toggled using an optional reveal button.

[source,tsx]
----
<PasswordField label="Password" value="Ex@mplePassw0rd" />

== Reveal Button

The reveal button allows the user to disable masking and see the value they have typed in. This is especially helpful on mobile devices, where typing is more error-prone. In cases where this feature isn’t desired, it can be disabled.

[source,tsx]
----
<PasswordField
  label="Password"
  value="Ex@mplePassw0rd"
  revealButtonHidden
/>
