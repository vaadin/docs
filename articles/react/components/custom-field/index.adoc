== Basic Usage

Custom Field is optimized for wrapping the following components:

* <<../text-field#,Text Field>>
* <<../number-field#,Number Filed>>
* <<../password-field#,Password Field>>
* <<../text-area#,Text Area>>
* <<../select#,Select>>
* <<../combo-box#,Combo Box>>
* <<../date-picker#,Date Picker>>
* <<../time-picker#,Time Picker>>

// TODO no list-box yet
// It can also be used to provide a label, helper, and the other field features, for components that don't have them built-in, such as <<../list-box#,List Box>>.
