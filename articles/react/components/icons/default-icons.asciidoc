= Default Icons

The icon component renders these icons as inline SVGs by default, but both are also available as font icons and standalone SVG images.


== Vaadin Icons

Each Vaadin icon is defined on a 16&times;16 pixel canvas without whitespace around it, but it's rendered by default in a 24&times;24 pixel size. Many components, though, apply padding around the icons to shrink them to a size matching the Lumo icons.

Vaadin Icons are rendered as inline SVGs by the icon component, but they're also available as https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/blob/main/packages/icons/assets/fonts/Vaadin-Icons.woff[an icon font,window=_blank] and https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/tree/main/packages/icons/assets/svg[standalone SVG images,window=_blank].

== Lumo Icons

Lumo Icons are used in the default Lumo theme for Vaadin components.

Each of the Lumo Icons is rendered on a 24&times;24 pixel canvas, with a 16&times;16 pixel active area for the icon itself, and 4 pixels of whitespace around each.

Lumo Icons are rendered as inline SVGs by the icon component, but they're also available as https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/blob/main/packages/vaadin-lumo-styles/font-icons.js[an icon font,window=_blank] and https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/tree/main/packages/vaadin-lumo-styles/icons/svg[standalone SVG images,window=_blank].
