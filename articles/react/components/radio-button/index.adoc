[source,tsx]

  <RadioButton value="economy" label="Economy" />
  <RadioButton value="business" label="Business" />
  <RadioButton value="firstClass" label="First Class" />
</RadioGroup>

== States

=== Read-Only

Use read-only when content needs to be accessible, but not editable. Read-only elements can't be edited, but they are part of the tabbing order and can thus receive focus. The content of a read-only input can be selected and copied.

[source,tsx]
----
<RadioGroup label="Status" readonly>
  <RadioButton value="inProgress" label="In progress" checked />
  <RadioButton value="done" label="Done" />
  <RadioButton value="cancelled" label="Cancelled" />
</RadioGroup>
----

=== Disabled

Disable a field to mark it as unavailable currently. The disabled state is used for fields that aren't editable and don't need to be readable. Disabled elements can't be focused and may be inaccessible to assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

Disabling can be preferable to hiding an element to prevent layout changes when the element's visibility changes. It also can make users aware of its existence even when it's currently unavailable.

[source,tsx]
----
<RadioGroup label="Status" disabled>
  <RadioButton value="inProgress" label="In progress" checked />
  <RadioButton value="done" label="Done" />
  <RadioButton value="cancelled" label="Cancelled" />
</RadioGroup>
----


== Orientation

The component's default orientation is horizontal. However, vertical orientation is recommended whenever possible. It's typically easier for the user to scan a vertical list of options:

[source,tsx]
----
<RadioGroup label="Status" theme="vertical">
  <RadioButton value="pending" label="Pending" checked />
  <RadioButton value="submitted" label="Submitted" />
  <RadioButton value="confirmed" label="Confirmed" />
</RadioGroup>
----

In cases where vertical space needs to be conserved, horizontal orientation can be used. However, it's recommended to have no more than three options:

[source,tsx]
----
<RadioGroup label="Status" theme="horizontal">
  <RadioButton value="pending" label="Pending" checked />
  <RadioButton value="submitted" label="Submitted" />
  <RadioButton value="confirmed" label="Confirmed" />
</RadioGroup>
----
