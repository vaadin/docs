== Basic Usage

Auto Form requires a Java service that implements the `CrudService<T, ID>` interface. In the example here, the `EmployeeService` class extends `CrudRepositoryService<T, ID, R>`, which in turn implements the `CrudService<T, ID>`:

[.example]
--
[source,java]
.EmployeeService.java
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/crud/EmployeeService.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
[source,java]
.Employee.java
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/crud/Employee.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
[source,java]
.EmployeeRepository.java
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/fusion/crud/EmployeeRepository.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

Hilla generates TypeScript objects for each `@BrowserCallable` service implementing the `CrudService<T, ID>` interface. These TypeScript objects have callable methods that execute the corresponding Java service methods, enabling the Add, Update, and Delete operations as well as lazy data loading with sorting and filtering.

For the `EmployeeService` example, you can import the generated TypeScript object in your React view, and use it as a value for the `<AutoForm service={EmployeeService} />` property to render the form.

Here's what the rendered form looks like:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-basic.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

As you can see in the above example, Auto Form component renders a form with fields for all properties of the `Employee` entity. When submitting the form, the data is automatically submitted to the `save` method of the configured `CrudService`.
.Default Responsive Breakpoints
[NOTE]
Auto Form uses the <<../form-layout#,Form Layout component>>'s  default responsive breakpoints. To customize them, see the <<customizing-form-layout,Customizing Form Layout>> section.

== Customizing Visibility & Order

Auto Form by default renders input fields for all properties of the entity in a Form Layout with a two-column layout, except for the properties annotated by `@Id` and `@Version`. You can customize the visibility and order of fields using `visibleFields` property:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-field-visibility.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

.Don't Expose Sensitive Data on Client-Side
[CAUTION]
When using Auto Form, it's important to check that you don't expose sensitive data to the client-side. For example, if you have a `password` property in your entity, hiding it using `visibleFields` does not prevent the data from being sent to the client-side. Make sure your service implementation doesn't expose sensitive data to the client-side. You could do this, for example, by using a `@JsonIgnore` annotation on the property.

== Customizing Field Properties

You can customize the properties of the fields rendered by Auto Form by using the `fieldOptions` property.

=== Overriding Field Options

You can customize some options of the automatically rendered fields by Auto Form by using the `fieldOptions` property.

==== Customizing Field Label

To customize the label of a field, use the `label` property of the `fieldOptions` property as follows:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-field-custom-label.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

The above example shows how to customize the label of the `firstName` and `lastName` fields.

==== Customizing Field Column Span

As Auto Form component uses the Form Layout component as the layout, you can customize the `colspan` property of the fields rendered by Auto Form by using the `fieldOptions` property as follows:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-field-colspan.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

==== Customizing Input Component

You can use the `renderer` property of the `fieldOptions` to override the rendered field by Auto Form. The following example shows how to render a Text Area component for the description field:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-field-custom-renderer.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

== Customizing Form Layout

You can customize the Form Layout component used by Auto Form by using the `formLayoutProps` property. For example, you can set the `responsiveSteps` property to customize the responsive breakpoints of the Form Layout component:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-responsive-steps.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

== Using Custom Renderer

In case you want to render field in completely different layout, You can use a custom renderer to define any arbitrary layout using the `layoutRenderer` property.

To use a custom renderer, define a function that takes the `AutoFormLayoutRendererProps` as a parameter and returns any React element. The `AutoFormLayoutRendererProps` contains the following properties:

- `children`: the read-only list of bound fields
- `form`: the form binder instance

As the children property is a read-only list of bound fields, you can use them right away in your custom renderer. The following example shows how to use the `children` property to render the fields in a two-column layout:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-custom-renderer-alt.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

Alternatively, you can create input fields manually, and use the `form` instance to connect them to the form. 

The following example shows how to render fields manually:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-custom-renderer.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

== Managing Form State

Auto Form component enables you to manage the form state in different scenarios such as editing an item versus creating a new one, handling after submission events, and so on.

The following properties are available for managing the form state or reacting to form events:

- `item`: the item to be edited. If the item is `null`, the form is in _new_ mode, otherwise it is in _edit_ mode.
- `disabled`: disables the whole form.
- `afterSubmit`: a callback function that is called after the form is submitted successfully.

The following example shows how to use the `item` property to manage switching between _new_ and _edit_ modes, and `afterSubmit` for informing the user about the form submission success. In addition, it uses `disabled` property is also used to toggle the form's disabled state:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-edit-new-modes.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

Auto Form component supports Deletion functionality out of the box which is associated with calling the `delete` method from the `CrudService` introduced to the Auto Form. The following properties are associated with managing this functionality:

- `deleteButtonVisible`: whether to show the delete button in the form which is hidden by default. If enabled, the delete button is only shown when editing an existing item, that means that `item` property is not null.
- `afterDelete`: a callback function that is called after the item is deleted successfully.


The following example shows how to use the `deleteButtonVisible` property to show the Delete button, and uses the `afterDelete` property to inform the user about the deletion success. You can toggle between the _edit_ and _new_ modes to see its effect on the visibility of the Delete button in action:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-delete-after-delete.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

The following properties are associated with managing the form actions error handling:

- `onSubmitError`: a callback that is called if an unexpected error occurs while submitting the form. The callback receives the error as a parameter.
- `onDeleteError`: a callback that is called if an unexpected error occurs while deleting the item. The callback receives the error as a parameter.

The following example shows how to use the `onSubmitError` and `onDeleteError` callbacks to inform the user about the respective error:

[.example.desktop]
--
[source,tsx]
----
include::{root}/frontend/demo/component/auto-form/react/auto-form-on-errors.tsx[render,frame,tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
--

.On Submit Error is not called for validation errors
[NOTE]
Note that `onSubmitError` callback is not be called for form validation errors, which are handled automatically.
