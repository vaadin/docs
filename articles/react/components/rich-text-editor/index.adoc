Rich Text Editor allows you to format and style text using boldface, italics, headings, lists, images, links, etc.

[source,tsx]
----
const richTextDelta = '[{"insert":"Type something here and format it "},{"attributes":{"underline":true},"insert":"as you want"},{"insert":".\n"}]';

return <RichTextEditor style={{ maxHeight: "400px" }} value={richTextDelta} />;
----


== Value Format

Rich Text Editor supports HTML format and the https://github.com/quilljs/delta[Quill Delta format] for reading and setting its value.

To read or write a value in the Delta format, use the `value` property. To read or write a value in HTML format, use the `htmlValue` property and the `dangerouslySetHtmlValue` method.

.Sanitize HTML
[NOTE]
To prevent someone injecting malicious content, be sure to sanitize HTML strings before passing them to the web component using `dangerouslySetHtmlValue`. An example of this would be using a library such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify[`dompurify`].


== Read-Only

Setting the component to read-only hides the toolbar and makes the content non-editable.

[source,tsx]
----
<RichTextEditor
  style={{ maxHeight: "400px" }}
  readonly
  value={richTextDelta}
/>
----


== Height

Unless set to a fixed height, Rich Text Area automatically adjusts its height based on its content. The automatic resizing can be restricted to a minimum and maximum height, though, as you can see in the example here:

[source,tsx]
----
<RichTextEditor
  style={{ minHeight: "200px", maxHeight: "400px" }}
  value={richTextDelta}
/>
----


== Theme Variants

Rich Text Editor has two theme variants, which are described below.

=== Compact

Apply the `compact` theme to make the toolbar more compact.

[source,tsx]
----
<RichTextEditor
  style={{ maxHeight: "400px" }}
  theme="compact"
  value={richTextDelta}
/>
----


=== No Border

Apply the `no-border` theme variant to remove Rich Text Editor's border. An example of this is when the component is wrapped in a container with its own borders.

[source,tsx]
----
<RichTextEditor
  style={{ maxHeight: "400px" }}
  theme="no-border"
  value={richTextDelta}
/>
----
