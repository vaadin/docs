= Avatar

== Content

Avatar has three properties: *name*, *abbreviation*, and *image*.

=== Name and Abbreviation

Hovering shows the name in a tooltip.
After setting a name, Avatar auto-generates and display an abbreviation of the specified name.
For example, “Allison Torres” becomes “AT”, “John Smith” becomes “JS”, and so on.

You can set manually the abbreviation.
Abbreviations should not exceed two or three characters.

=== Image

Avatar can be used to display images, such as user profile pictures or company logos.
Abbreviations aren't shown when images are used.

== Avatar Group
Avatar Group is used to group multiple Avatars together.
It can be used, for example, to show that there are multiple users viewing the same page or for listing members of a project.

[source,tsx]
----
<AvatarGroup
  items={persons.map((person) => ({
    name: `${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`,
  }))}
/>
----

=== Maximum Number of Items
You can specify the maximum number of items an Avatar Group should display.
Items that overflow are grouped into a single Avatar that displays the overflow count.
Hovering shows the name of each hidden item in a tooltip.
Clicking the overflow item displays the overflowing avatars and names in a list.

== Background Color
By default, there are seven background colors you can use for Avatar.
Use the color index to set the background color.
