description: Avatar is a graphical representation of an object or entity, such as a person or an organization.

= Avatar

[source,tsx]

<Avatar />
<Avatar name={`${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`} />
<Avatar
  img={person.pictureUrl}
  name={`${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`}
/>

== Content

Avatar has three properties: *name*, *abbreviation*, and *image*. These are described in the sections that follow.


=== Name & Abbreviation

Hovering shows the name in a tooltip. After setting a name, Avatar auto-generates and displays an abbreviation of the specified name. For example, "Allison Torres" becomes "AT", "John Smith" becomes "JS", and so on.

You can set the abbreviation, manually. However, abbreviations should not exceed two or three characters.


=== Image

Avatar can be used to display images, such as user profile pictures or company logos. Abbreviations aren't shown when images are used.



== Avatar Group

Avatar Group is used to group multiple Avatars together. It might be used, for example, to show that there are multiple users viewing the same page or for listing members of a project.

[source,tsx]
----
<AvatarGroup
  items={persons.map((person) => ({
    name: `${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`,
  }))}
/>
----


=== Maximum Number of Items

You can specify the maximum number of items an Avatar Group should display. Items that overflow are grouped into a single Avatar that displays the overflow count. 

Hovering, though, shows the name of each hidden item in a tooltip. Clicking the overflow item displays the overflowing avatars and names in a list.



== Background Color

By default, there are seven background colors you can use for Avatar. Use the color index to set the background color.



== Internationalization (i18n)

All texts in Avatar and Avatar Group are configurable.
