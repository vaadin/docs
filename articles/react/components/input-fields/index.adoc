= Input Fields

== Label

An input field should have a label to identify it.
Labels should be clear, concise, and written in sentence case.
Avoid unclear and verbose language.
Use <<helper,helper texts>> to give more guidance, or tooltips in case a helper text can't be accommodated.

[source,tsx]
----
<EmailField label="Email address" />
----

In situations where enough context is provided, such as grid filters and search fields, visible labels can be omitted.
In such cases, an `aria-label` attribute should be provided instead to identify the field, so that users of assistive technologies can interpret the input correctly.

== Helper

Helpers provide information when needed so that end users can fill in a form or field without errors.
For example, they are helpful when the field requires a specific format.
Helpers typically consist of plain text, but HTML and other components are also supported.

[source,tsx]
----
<TextField label="Phone number" helperText="Include country prefix" />
----

== Required

Input fields can be either optional or required.
Optional fields are typically left unmarked.
In the default theme, required fields are marked with a bullet character.
It's recommended to provide hint text to let users know how required fields are marked:

[source,tsx]
----
<HorizontalLayout theme="spacing">
  <TextField label="Name" required errorMessage="Name is required" />
  <DatePicker label="Date of birth" />
</HorizontalLayout>
----

== Non-Editable Fields

Sometimes, the user isn't allowed to edit the value of certain fields.
Those fields can made read-only or disabled, depending on the situation.
Choose the appropriate choice.

[source,tsx]
----
<HorizontalLayout theme="spacing">
  <TextField label="Read-only" readonly value="Value" />
  <TextField label="Disabled" disabled value="Value" />
</HorizontalLayout>
----

== Focus

Focus styles are used to highlight the active element, which is useful for keyboard navigation.
The focus style is different for keyboards and pointing devices.
