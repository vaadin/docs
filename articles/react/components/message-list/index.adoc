= Message List

You might use Message List, for instance, for displaying a chat log. You can configure the text content, information about the sender, and the time of sending for each message.

[source,tsx]
----
<MessageList
  items={[
    {
      text: "Linsey, could you check if the details with the order are okay?",
      time: yesterday,
      userName: "Matt Mambo",
      userColorIndex: 1,
    },
    {
      text: "All good. Ship it.",
      time: fiftyMinutesAgo,
      userName: "Linsey Listy",
      userColorIndex: 2,
      userImg: person?.pictureUrl,
    },
  ]}
/>
----

The messages in the list can be populated with the `items` property. The `items` property is of type [classname]`Array`, with JSON objects in it. Each JSON object is a single message.


== Styling

You can style individual messages by adding a theme property to some items and providing CSS for that theme.
