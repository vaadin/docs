They require users to be informed and explicitly give consent to the usage of cookies.

[source,tsx]
----
<CookieConsent />
----

By default, a banner is at the top of the screen with predefined text, a link to https://www.cookiesandyou.com[cookiesandyou.com] which explains what cookies are, and a consent button.


== Localization

Cookie Consent is fully customizable. You can customize the message, the "Learn More" link, the "Dismiss" button, as well as the component's position.

[source,tsx]
----
<CookieConsent
  message="Tämä sivusto käyttää evästeitä parhaan kokemuksen tarjoamiseksi"
  dismiss="Selvä"
  learnMore="Lue lisää"
  learnMoreLink="https://vaadin.com/terms-of-service"
/>
----


== Positioning

Cookie Consent can be positioned in the viewport in four non-stretched positions, or stretched across the top or bottom:

[cols="<,>"]
|===
|Top left
|Top right

|Bottom left
|Bottom right
|===

[cols="^"]
|===
|Top -- stretch, default
|Bottom -- stretch
|===

On smaller viewports, the component always takes up the entire width of the viewport.


== Theming

Cookie Consent's theme is modified using CSS.
