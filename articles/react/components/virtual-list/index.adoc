title: Virtual List
description: Virtual List allows you to render a long list of items inside a scrollable container without sacrificing performance. Each item is rendered on the fly as the user scrolls the list.

= Virtual List

To use the component, you need to assign it a set of data items and a renderer that’s used to render each individual data item. The height of an item is determined by its content and can change dynamically.

[source,jsx]

const data = Array.from(Array(100).keys()).map((i) => "◯".repeat(i));

return (
  <VirtualList items={data}>{({ item }) => <span>{item}</span>}</VirtualList>
);
