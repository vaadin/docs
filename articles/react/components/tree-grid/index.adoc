= Tree Grid

Tree Grid is an extension of the Grid component. All of Grid's features are available in Tree Grid. It isn't meant, though, to be used as a navigation menu.


[source,tsx]
----
const people = usePeople();

const dataProvider = useCallback(
  async (
    params: GridDataProviderParams<Person>,
    callback: GridDataProviderCallback<Person>
  ) => {
    const filtered = people.filter(
      (p) => !params.parentItem || p.managerId === params.parentItem.id
    );
    return callback(filtered, filtered.length);
  },
  []
);

return (
  <Grid itemHasChildrenPath="manager" dataProvider={dataProvider}>
    <GridTreeColumn path="firstName" />
    <GridColumn path="lastName" />
    <GridColumn path="email" />
  </Grid>
);

== Tree Column

The tree column is a column that contains the toggles for expanding and collapsing nodes. Nodes are opened and closed by clicking a tree column's cell. They can also be toggled programmatically.


.[methodname]`scrollToIndex()` isn't reliable.
[CAUTION]
The behavior of the [methodname]`scrollToIndex()` method in Tree Grid isn't deterministic due to lazy-loading hierarchical data. It isn't recommended that you use this method.
