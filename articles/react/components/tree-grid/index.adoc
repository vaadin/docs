description: Tree Grid is a component for displaying hierarchical tabular data grouped into expandable and collapsible nodes.

= Tree Grid

Tree Grid is an extension of the Grid component. Therefore, all of Grid's features are available in Tree Grid. It isn't meant, though, to be used as a navigation menu.

const dataProvider = useCallback(
  async (
    params: GridDataProviderParams<Person>,
    callback: GridDataProviderCallback<Person>
  ) => {
    const pagedPeople = usePagedPeople({
      count: params.pageSize,
      startIndex: params.page * params.pageSize,
      managerId: params.parentItem ? params.parentItem.id : null,
    });
    return callback(pagedPeople.people, pagedPeople.hierarchyLevelSize);
  },
  []
);

return (
  <Grid itemHasChildrenPath="manager" dataProvider={dataProvider}>
    <GridTreeColumn path="firstName" />
    <GridColumn path="lastName" />
    <GridColumn path="email" />
  </Grid>
);

== Tree Column

The tree column is a column that contains the toggles for expanding and collapsing nodes. Nodes are opened and closed by clicking a tree column's cell. They can also be toggled programmatically.


.[methodname]`scrollToIndex()` Isn't Reliable.
[CAUTION]
The behavior of the [methodname]`scrollToIndex()` method in Tree Grid isn't deterministic due to lazy-loading hierarchical data. Don't use this method.
