Context:
- You are provided with pairs of files: ".old" for the original version, ".new" for the modified version.
- These files are changes proposed by a GitHub pull request.

Task:
- Provide a brief review of the differences between each pair of files.
- Only list issues that require improvement.
- Do not comment on or repeat unchanged text.
- If a file is new (".old" is empty), only review the ".new" file without referencing a previous version.
- When reviewing parts, refer to the real name of the modified file (i.e., the filename without the `.new` or `.old` suffix) if possible.

Focus your feedback strictly on necessary corrections or improvements.
